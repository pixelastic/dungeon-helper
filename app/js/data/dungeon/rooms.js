A hole in the ceiling allows some of the smoke from the fire to escape, but much of it expands across the ceiling and rolls down to fill the room in a dark fog.

  'A pit yawns open before you just on the other side of the door\'s threshold. The entire floor of the room has fallen into a second room beneath it. Across the way you can spy a door in the wall now 15 feet off the rubble-strewn floor, and near the center of the room stands a thick column of mortared stone that appears to hold the spiral staircase that leads down to what was the lower level.',
  'A priceless painting.  Thought stolen.  Now worthless.',
  'A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the floor. Looking into the room is like looking down on a forest. Tall tangles of fungus resemble forested hills, the barren floor looks like a plain between the woods, and even a trickle of water and a puddle of water that pools in a low spot bears a resemblance to a river and lake, respectively.',

  'A salamander with a clockwork foot',
  'A section of floor is bumpy and uneven, making rapid movement difficult. The paving slabs can be easily pried up, but nothing of interest lies beneath.',

  'A sinkhole pierces the passage’s floor blocking further progress. The sinkhole is 5 ft. wide and 120 ft. deep. Danger lurks here for the far side of the sinkhole is unstable; anyone jumping across and landing within 5 ft of the edge causes an additional collapse, which drops unfortunate adventurers into the lightless depths below.',
  'A skeleton dressed in moth-eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now-open lock. Dust coats something sticky on the needles\' points.',

  'A soiled apron and an over turned butterchurn.',

  'Tesla coils, iron cage, hanging chains, sleeping abomination.',
  'Texts about the alteration of lizardmen hormone messages.',
  'There are dancing shadows in this room. They stalk each other across the walls and one by one kill each other. This repeats over and over.',
  'There are several not so neat rows of school desks and chairs in this room. In front of them is a large blackboard. Written on the blackboard with chalk are extremely basic fighting manouvers, like \'Hit the enemy with your sword\', \'Block attacks with your shield\', \'Protect the Wizard\', \'When wounded have the cleric heal you\'. There are also diagrams illustrating these manouvers.',
  'There are small cages in this room. In the cages are snakes. The snakes can easily escape through the bars if they so choose. The snakes are non-poisonous and harmless. There are lots of dead mice outside the cages.',
  'There are small grates on the sides of this room, from which float tiny sweet smelling bubbles, which frequently pop loudly.',
  'There are so many carpets of various kind on the floor of this room that simply getting into the room is a bit hard.',
  'There are strange faraway sounds of people talking in this room. The sounds can not be deciphered. The room is completely empty.',
  'There are three grand pianos in this room. On the walls are blue velvet curtains. On the ceiling is a copper chandelier, lit by surprisingly huge candles. If one tries playing the pianos he discovers that they are tuned in different ways. One sounds almost dainty, one plays somber sad sounds, and the third can only do grim dark, regardless of the song played.',
  'There are three small birds in this room. They fly around, apparently playing with each other and completely ignoring everything else. Trying to interact with them reveals them to be harmless ghost birds.',
  'There is an odd smell in this room, as if someone had recently been cooking there. However, the floor is polished clean marble and the walls and ceiling are perfectly white stone.',
  'There is a bloodtrail on the floor of this room. The trail is in a spiral pattern from the entrance to the center of the room. If someone follows the pattern all the way to the center it vanishes and is replaced with red string. At the end of the string there is an amulet with a lion crest.',
  'There is a golden statue of a terrifying demon in this room. The statue is much too big to be carried out, and the gold is fake.',
  'There is a monkey in this room. When the party enters, the monkey says \'Ug?\' and runs away. There are banana peels on the floor.',
  'There is a rug on the floor of this room. The rug resembles very high grass, and wading through it is difficult.',
  'There is a sword practise doll made of wood affixed to the center of this room. It is full of cuts and scrapes. There are no swords anywhere.',
  'There\'s a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.',
  'The burble of water reaches your ears after you open the door to this room. You see the source of the noise in the far wall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with the figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.',
  'The ceiling is covered in black cones.',
  'The ceiling of this room is an arching dome with hundreds of tiny round openings in it, apparently air vents or perhaps speaking tubes. Faint whispers can be heard as you pass, but they are so garbled together that it\'s impossible to make out what any are saying.',
  'The ceiling of this room is so low that to get through it the largest member of the party needs to bend down slightly.',
  'The doors into this room are heavy iron, and extremely hard to open. It looks like a graveyard, but all of the graves are empty. Only the headstones remain, but they are too old for anyone to read the inscriptions. The walls have been painted with the image of a vast graveyard.',
  'The doors, floor, ceiling, and walls of this room are all a mirror. Breaking a part of the mirror surface reveals small lockers all around the room. None of them are locked. They contain buttons, a couple of coins, needles, thread, tiny picture frames, non-magical rings and amulets, and all sorts of other knick knacks.',
  'The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream. Three tables bend beneath a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping. Several bookshelves stand nearby stuffed to overfilling with a jumble of books, jars, bottles, bags, and boxes. The alchemist who set this all up doesn\'t seem to be present, but a beaker of green fluid boils over a burner on one of the tables.',
  'The door in front of you seems to be stuck. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs yank it open, it comes open. Read the following: A furious rumble resounds in the area as stones come clattering through the doorway, along with a thick cloud of rock dust. The room beyond is filled with rubble.',
  'The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges. Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble tiles. Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the room along with some small reading tables.',
  'The entrances to this room have been covered with floral pattern curtains. The room itself is boringly grey. There\'s a large loom here, and several spools of different kinds of thread. In the corner is a basket with a couple of warm shirts.',
  'The faint scent of burnt flesh reaches the party’s nostrils.',
  'The first frog.  The last swamp.',
  'The floor before you is sagging and cracked, as if the supports beneath it had been broken. (Balance check, DC 10 when crossing) There is a relatively clear path through, though not a straight one.',
  'The floor is lava, spanned by bridge.',
  'The floor of this room is covered in images of feathers. The walls are painted with images of wildlife. The ceiling is one huge red sun.',
  'The floor of this room is covered in marble tiles. The tiles have different coloured numbers on them, but these seem completely random. Walking on any of the tiles makes them break, and the person who did so falls a half a feet down to the real floor (and receives no damage).',
  'The floor of this room is littered with pencils and partially finished sketches of the same beautiful woman. Each picture is missing a different part of her.',
  'The floor of this room is littered with the shards of thousands of bits of broken crockery. There doesn\'t seem to be any way to walk across without the bits crunching under foot.',
  'The floor of this room is made of countless bamboo rings. There are empty paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. On the walls are samurai swords. Inspecting the swords reveals them to be very high class replicas, useless for combat.',
  'The floor of this room is slightly damp. The room is entirely violet.',
  'The floor of this room is wildly uneven. Standing on one side one gets the impression that the other side is impossibly small, and vice versa.',
  'The haft of a pickaxe lies in the floor. Nearby, the rest of it is embedded in a wall.',
  'The manacles set into the walls of this room give you the distinct impression that it was used as a prison and torture chamber, although you can see no evidence of torture devices. One particularly large set of manacles -- big enough for an ogre -- have been broken open.',
  'The opposite of a panda bear.',
  'The room is a centrifuge.  Killer orbs.',
  'The rubble from a broken stalagmite covers the floor, nearby to its stump that yet juts up from the floor.',
  'The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and shattered wood grows white fungus.',
  'The skeletal remains of a pony lie in front of an overturned mine cart. The cart partially blocks the passageway and examination of the skeleton reveals the animal likely broke a leg and was left here to die.',
  'The sound of soft laugher followed by the soft clatter of shifting rocks comes from somewhere ahead.',
  'The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone\'s wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish.',
  'The walls here were once decorated with brightly painted images painted directly onto the smooth stone. The colours have long since faded, and now only a suggestion of what once was remains.',
  'The walls of this room are covered with ancient tapestries. They are rotten and full of carpet bugs. The floor is made of wood, which has somehow survived in perfectly pristine condition.',
  'The walls of this room are full of text in red ink. The ink has worn out, and not one word is legible.',
  'The walls of this room are lined with book shelves, though where the books might be you have no clue. The shelves appear to have been recently dusted.11) This room feels too large for its size, as if someone had crammed a much larger room into the space it now occupies. There are green plants growing down from the ceiling. The ceiling looks to be made of soil, though none of it appears to be falling down.',
  'The walls of this room have been decorated with different coloured marble eyes. They all seem to stare at anyone entering, but this is only a feeling one gets.',
  'The walls of this room have pictures of weird animals. Horses with human heads. Donkeys with dragon wings. Gigantic insects attacking a castle. Lizards with chicken legs. A cuckoo bird the size of an elephant being ridden by a minotaur. Dogs with horns headbutting each other. A cat with three tails.',
  'Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you can barely feel. One corner of the ceiling has a particularly large clot of webbing within which a goblin\'s bones are tangled.',
  'Thick fug. Rancid divan. Sleeping Tallowbride.',
  'Thick mud covers the cavern floor. A discarded spade lies near a partially dug grave. A thick brown sludge of mud and water fills the grave to a depth of about one foot. It is otherwise empty.',
  'Thick spider webs cover the entrance to a side tunnel. A faint, but unpleasant, smell emerges from the tunnel. The spider is long dead, but the desiccated remains of its victims yet remain.',
  'Thick webs fill this area. A faint breeze issues from cracks in the rock causing the webs to gently undulate.',
  'Thieves guild refining formian polyps into drug',
  'Thirteen adult bodies sewn together in one giant masterpiece.',
  'This blue painted room has a staircase in the middle, which seems to lead nowhere. Climbing the staircase takes one to another room, which has been painted red. The red room contains several sleeping bags and blankets.',
  'This chamber holds an odd contraption of metal and wood. It\'s a 20-foot-diameter circular platform that is tilted heavily to one side. Beneath it you can discern mechanisms that seem to attach to a large crank not far away. Above the platform hang metal weights on thin chains, which in turn are attached to discs and belts that are attached to other winches. It seems as though turning the winches turns and tilts the platform and sets the weights to moving. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This could be a training room for combat, but the PCs don\'t see any weapons inside. Certainly it would take a great deal of concentration to fight on the platform; perhaps it\'s a training room for monks or spellcasters.',
  'This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. Two great feathered wings droop from its back, both sculpted to look broken. The statue is skillfully crafted.',
  'This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners\' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn\'t allow you to see the full extent of them all.',
  'This chamber is tidal.',
  'This chamber of well-laid stones holds a wide bas-relief of a pastoral scene. In it you see a mountain like Mount Waterdeep, except that Castle Waterdeep and the city are missing. Instead, a small fishing village is a short way from a walled complex with several tall towers.',
  'This chamber served as an armory for some group of creatures. Armor and weapon racks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor. It hasn\'t been used in a long time, and all the useful weapons have been taken but for a single sword. Unlike the other weapons in the room, this one gleams untarnished in the light.',
  'This chamber was clearly smaller at one time, but something knocked down the wall that separated it from an adjacent room. Looking into that space, you see signs of another wall knocked over. It doesn\'t appear that anyone made an effort to clean up the rubble, but some paths through see more usage than others.',
  'This hall is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the floor is sticky with dried blood. It looks like the orcs and ogres were fighting. Some side was the victor but you\'re not sure which one. The bodies are largely stripped of valuables, but a few broken weapons jut from the slain or lie discarded on the floor.',
  'This hall stinks with the wet, pungent scent of mildew. Black mold grows in tangled veins across the walls and parts of the floor. Despite the smell, it looks like it might be safe to travel through. A path of stone clean of mold wends its way through the hallway.',
  'This is a kitchen. There are no kitchen implements anywhere, and not one scrap of food. All of the cupboards are empty, all of the tables are clean. There are candlestands here, but no candles.',
  'This is clearly a throne room, but someone has taken the throne. This is the feeling the party gets, but it is verified by the picture on the wall where the throne still stands.',
  'This is the bottom of the bottomless pit.',
  'This narrow room at first appears to be a dead-end corridor, but then you note several metal plates on the walls set at about eye height. Looking more closely, you see that one of these plates is slid aside to reveal a peephole.',
  'This otherwise bare room has one distinguishing feature. The stone around one of the other doors has been pulled over its edges, as though the rock were as soft as clay and could be moved with fingers. The stone of the door and wall seems hastily molded together.',
  'This room contains a cobble stone floor and a well. The well is deep and dark. There is a winch for a bucket which is down below. Using the winch to bring the bucket up reveals it and the bottom of the well to be full of black sand.',
  'This room contains a few dusty bathtubs. A couple of them are hooked up to pipes coming from the walls. All of them are dry, and nothing comes from the pipes if someone tries them.',
  'This room contains a library, but all of the books are empty. None of them even have titles.',
  'This room contains a railroad which connects the entrances. There is a small minecart on the track near where the party comes in. The track is slightly rusted, and walking is faster than using the cart.',
  'This room contains a series of jail cells. None of them are locked. One contains an old leather armor.',
  'This room contains a sword stand. There are five places for swords, but only two swords. The first is so used it has turned blunt, and the other is broken in half.',
  'This room contains numerous slowly melting ice sculptures. It\'s hard to tell what any of them used to look like.51) There is a mist crawling across the floor of this room. It moves like a wild sea. Above the mist hang tiny clouds of smoke. Kneeling into the mist one gets the impression of being underwater.',
  'This room contains several baskets of dirty clothing.',
  'This room eats all sounds. Nothing can be heard while within, and no sound can be made. There is a pedestal by the side of the room. On it is an emerald. If someone takes the emerald out of the room it breaks. Breaking the emerald dispels the sound eating effect.',
  'This room feels ancient. It looks like the inside of a castle tower. Inspecting the stonework gives the impression that it once was an actual room in a castle tower which someone carried here piece by piece and then assembled in exactly the same way. There is a lavish bed here which would make even the haughtiest of princesses sigh with envy. The entrance(s) to the room were once locked, but the locks have rusted away.',
  'This room feels friendly. It is decorated in a red rose pattern all throughout. There is a deck of playing cards on a rose patterned table here. The playing cards all depict different kinds of roses.',
  'This room has about two thousand cardboard boxes. None of them contain anything, except perhaps more boxes.',
  'This room has a black and white checkerboard pattern on the floor, and is separated into several sections by large red curtains. Each section is somehow soundproof so that no sound passes to the others sections.36) This room is decorated like the inside of an arabian tent. The beautiful fabrics used as decoration each have their own exotic scent, as if someone had been collecting perfumes from all around the world and then sprayed them randomly everywhere. On the floor are several chairs, an empty table, and a chest full of empty perfume bottles.',
  'This room has a bouncy floor made of somekind of red material. The ceiling isn\'t low enough for anyone to bang their head on it by accident. Slashing at the material breaks it, and makes it useless for anything other than covering material.',
  'This room has a checkerboard pattern on its floor in black and white, and a similar pattern on its ceiling in red and blue. Someone has left a mop in a bucket of soapy water near the entrance the party comes in from.',
  'This room has a cracked ceiling support. The ceiling has caved in, and there is just about enough room by the sides for the party to pass through.',
  'This room has a grass floor. There are some flowers growing in it.',
  'This room has a puzzle floor. The floor tiles are on a track, and can be moved around. Moving them into the correct pattern makes them form a picture of a shadowy creature hiding behind a faraway tree on a grassy knoll. After completing the picture a secret compartment opens up on one of the walls with a loud click. Inside is a spyglass.',
  'This room has been completely painted with a sparkly blue and white pattern. It is so sparkly one has to squint hard to be able to even leave the room. ',
  'This room has been painted in tiger stripes. It contains a drum set.',
  'This room has grey stone walls, ceiling, and floor. There is a broken iron chandelier in the middle of it. The candles on the chandelier are only half burnt. There is a powerful echo in the room which amplifies all sounds made within.',
  'This room has laundry hanging from wires strung across it. All of the clothing is that of a highborn lady. All of it is freshly washed. There are empty wicker baskets on the floor.',
  'This room has several empty cubicles. There are windows on the walls, but they are empty and only show the wall they hang from.',
  'This room has two chests. They are made of lead, and apparently stuck to floor, as no-one will be able to lift them. One of them contains a doll which looks like a wizard, and the other one is empty. Searching the chest with the wizard doll uncovers a secret compartment. Inside it is a map. The map has several sections of the dungeon detailed, but only ones that the party has already been in.',
  'This room has walls of dark jagged rock. The ceiling has been painted black. The paint is still wet, and it is slowly dripping down to the grey floor. It is possible to cross the room carefully so that the paint doesn\'t fall on you.',
  'This room holds six dry circular basins large enough to hold a man and a dry fountain at its center. All possess chipped carvings of merfolk and other sea creatures. It looks like this room once served some group of people as a bath.',
  'This room is ON FIRE because salamander.',
  'This room is almost completely filled by an aquarium in the middle of it. There are plants living in it, but they have grown so thick that it is impossible to tell whether there is anything else living inside.',
  'This room is a garish yellow. There\'s a table with a candlestand in the corner. On the table is an inkwell, a fountain pen, and a half-finished note. The note reads \'This is it. They want us to leave this place. We are going to have to take a stand. Some of the others have already begun to\'.',
  'This room is a labyrinth of clear glass.',
  'This room is a library. All of the books are journals of a man named Ekhnaton. If anyone tries to read even one of them they will fall asleep. The journals are mindnumbingly boring. The sleep is non-magical, and waking the person is simple.',
  'This room is a mess. Empty wine bottles litter the floor. Chairs and tables have been thrown about as if there was a fight. There\'s cutlery and scraps of food everywhere.',
  'This room is a pool. There\'s no water. In the pool is a rope ten feet long, and a fallen ladder large enough for someone to climb out of it.',
  'This room is a raging inferno of fire. It isn\'t magical, and it will hurt. The magical effect of the room is in keeping the fire contained inside it. Carefully and slowly walking into the room one will realize that there is a safe narrow path inside which will take you to the other exit(s).21) This room is oval in shape with no distinct corners. The floor feels gritty beneath your feet, and the walls are painted with a continuous fresco of a seascape that surrounds you. Oddly, you feel that if you stay here for any time you\'ll become seasick.',
  'This room is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze doors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide. The double doors are peaked at their centers, but unlike many sets of double doors, their division isn\'t in the center. Instead, the crack between the doors resembles a crooked bolt of lightning, which a figure in a cloud carved in the stone above the door appears to be hurling. The lightning bolt strikes down roughly 2 feet to the right of center. The figure in the clouds is deliberately indistinct, but it appears male, having a beard and male proportions. The stroke of bronze electricity hits a tower that seems small compared to the figure. This tower cracks down the center, continuing the gap between the doors until it reaches the ground. To either side of the tower lie pastoral scenes of hillsides dotted with sheep. There doesn\'t appear to be a lock or handles.',
  'This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state. In their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up by six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful woman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors is skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor must have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman.',
  'This room is completely black. Within the black are stars. Millions of stars. Stepping into the room one gets the uncanny impression of floating in deep space. It is however a perfectly normal room otherwise.',
  'This room is completely empty save for a key on the floor near the opposite entrance.',
  'This room is dark. Really really dark. Any light source, magical or otherwise, which is brought into this room only illuminates it in a five foot radius. There is a human skeleton lying in the middle of the floor. It has a non-magical ring on its one remaining finger.',
  'This room is filled with broken machinery. In the corner of the room there is a cubicle inside which is a bathroom with a working steampower toilet, and a sink with a tap which produces a trickle of fresh water.',
  'This room is filled with burning candles, but they do not seem to be burning down. Extinguishing one extinguishes all of them, and none of them can no longer be lit after that.',
  'This room is filled with doors of all shapes and sizes. There are even a few window frames, and one comfortable couch.',
  'This room is filled with sawdust. Walking into it stirs it and it begins to float around. The sawdust sticks to anything it touches, like sawdust does.',
  'This room is fully padded with a white soft material.',
  'This room is hung with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of wear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years of neglect. They hang on all the walls and hang from the ceiling to brush against the floor, blocking your view of the rest of the room.',
  'This room is made of rusted iron. If one searches through the scrap on the floor he may find a usable hammer.',
  'This room is painted in a zebra pattern. There is a hat with brightly coloured feathers sticking from it on a shelf by the opposite entrance. If someone picks up the hat the sound of flute music is heard from somewhere beyond the room.',
  'This room is shattered. A huge crevasse shears the chamber in half, and the ground and ceilings are tilted away from it. It\'s as though the room was gripped in two enormous hands and broken like a loaf of bread. Someone has torn a tall stone door from its hinges somewhere else in the dungeon and used it to bridge the 15-foot gap of the chasm between the two sides of the room. Whatever did that must have possessed tremendous strength because the door is huge, and the enormous hinges look bent and mangled.',
  'This room is very muddy. There are several shovels and buckets in the mud.',
  'This room looks like a courtyard. There are two fountains here spewing dirty water at each other.',
  'This room looks like a living room, but there is no furniture in it, only outlines between gathering dust where furniture used be. The walls used to be full of paintings, but they\'ve been removed as well.',
  'This room looks like it was designed by drow. Rusted metal tiles create a huge mosaic of a spider in the floor, and someone set up rusted gratings like draperies of webs. At the far end of the chamber, the carving of a spider squats on the floor. It\'s about 3 feet tall and seems molded into the floor. Beyond it stands tall double doors of stone, their surface covered in a glittering web of gold.',
  'This room looks like the ransacked laboratory of a wizard. Everything in it has been torn apart, smashed to pieces, and broken violently. Searching through the wreckage one can find a couple of random first level scrolls.',
  'This room looks like the storage room of a ceramics shop. There are shelves full of all kids of plates, mugs, teapots, kettles, pots, pans, jugs, and the like.',
  'This room makes everyone entering it feel claustrophobic. The walls feel like they are constantly closing in, and ceiling looks menacing. It\'s perfectly safe to be there.',
  'This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling and spread across the floor. The slime seeps from the shattered stone of the ceiling at a snails crawl, forming a mess of dangling walls of gook. As you watch, a bit of the stuff separates from a sheet and drops to the ground with a wet plop.',
  'This room suffocates all in 1d4 rounds..',
  'This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone.',
  'This small bare chamber holds nothing but a large ironbound chest, which is big enough for a man to fit in and bears a heavy iron lock. The floor has a layer of undisturbed dust upon it.',
  'This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of a minotaur lies on the floor, its belly carved out. The creature\'s innards are largely missing, and yet you detect no other wounds. Bloody, froglike footprints track away from the corpse and out an open door.',
  'This small chamber seems divided into three parts. The first has several hooks on the walls from which hang dusty robes. An open curtain separates that space from the next, which has a dry basin set in the floor. Beyond that lies another parted curtain behind which you can see several straw mats in a semicircle pointing toward a statue of a dog-headed man. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The first part of the room may have been used for changing and cleaning feet before entering the room with the statue.',
  'This small room contains several pieces of well-polished wood furniture. Eight ornate, high-backed chairs surround a long oval table, and a side table stands next to the far exit. All bear delicate carvings of various shapes. One bears carvings of skulls and bones, another is carved with shields and magic circles, and a third is carved with shapes like flames and lightning strokes. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The eight chairs represent the eight schools of magic.',
  'This small room is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls. The seats all have holes in their top, like a privy. Facing stones on the front of the benches prevent you from seeing how deep the holes go. It looks like a communal bathroom. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> The PCs may have heard that these are common in Chessenta, but that country is hundreds of miles to the east and south.',
  'This tiny room holds a curious array of machinery. Winches and levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle from the ceiling. On a nearby wall, you note a pictogram of what looks like a scythe on a chain. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This room may be a control center for traps elsewhere in the dungeon.',

  'Three chests of semiprecious stones and a mimic.',
  'Three fairies want song contest judged. Stakes: Life.',

  'You catch a whiff of the unmistakable metallic tang of blood as you open the door. The floor is covered with it, and splashes of blood spatter the walls. Some drops even reach the ceiling. It looks fresh, but you don\'t see any bodies or footprints leaving the chamber.',
  'You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you\'re uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber. The wall was an illusion and whoever cast it must be nearby!',
  'You feel a sense of foreboding upon peering into this cavernous chamber. At its center lies a low heap of refuse, rubble, and bones atop which sit several huge broken eggshells. Judging by their shattered remains, the eggs were big enough to hold a crouching man, making you wonder how large -- and where -- the mother is.',
  'You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor with the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight.',
  'You gaze into the room and hundreds of skulls gaze coldly back at you. They\'re set in niches in the walls in a checkerboard pattern, each skull bearing a half-melted candle on its head. The grinning bones stare vacantly into the room, which otherwise seems empty.',
  'You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall. Above it stands a strange statue of a lobster-headed and clawed woman. The statue is nearly 15 feet tall and holds the lobster claws crossed over its naked breasts.',
  'You open the door and a gout of flame rushes at your face. A wave of heat strikes you at the same time and light fills the hall. The room beyond the door is ablaze! An inferno engulfs the place, clinging to bare rock and burning without fuel.',
  'You open the door and before you is a dragon\'s hoard of treasure. Coins cover every inch of the room, and jeweled objects of precious metal jut up from the money like glittering islands in a sea of gold. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Taking one step in the room alerts the PCs to the disappointing truth. Their feet pass silently through the illusion of the coins to strike the solid floor beneath.',
  'You open the door to a long narrow room with a high ceiling. Three thick circles of wood rest on wooden stands. You\'re not certain what they are because you came into the room behind them. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs step in the room to get a better look, they see that each is painted with concentric circles marred by dozens of cuts into its surface. They\'re targets, and the PCs are on the wrong end of an archery range.',
  'You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and victors stripped them of their valuables.',
  'You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and each hole is roughly a foot wide. The water pours in columns that fall through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to some unknown depth. Each of the eight pillars of water drops as much liquid as a stream in winter thaw. The floor is damp and looks slippery.',
  'You open the door to reveal a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains. No other doors are in the room, and it appears the door you opened was created to blend in with the walls. Additionally, you see no ceiling. You must be at the bottom of a very deep spiked pit.',
  'You open the door to what must be a combat training room. Rough fighting circles are scratched into the surface of the floor. Wooden fighting dummies stand waiting for someone to attack them. A few punching bags hang from the ceiling. There\'s something peculiar about it all though. Every dummy is stocky and each has a bedraggled piece of leather hanging from its head that could be a long mask or a beard.',
  'You open the door, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose. Looking inside, you see a pile of refuse and offal that nearly reaches the ceiling. In the ceiling above it is a small hole that is roughly as wide as two human hands. No doubt some city dweller high above disposes of his rubbish without ever thinking about where it goes.',
  'You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn\'t so inviting. The floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. It looks like the room once held a bed, a desk, a chest, and a chair.',
  'You peer into this room and spot the white orb of a skull lying on the floor. Suddenly a stone falls from the ceiling and smashes the skull to pieces. An instant later, another stone from the ceiling drops to strike the floor and shatter. You hear a low rumbling and cracking noise. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The ceiling caves in during the next round.',
  'You peer through the open doorway into a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved as tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest. Stone root systems crawl out into the floor and marble branches expand across the ceiling. You even note a few carvings of small birds and squirrels. Beautiful as they are, the sculpting doesn\'t appear elven, and it\'s nothing dwarves would carve.',
  'You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to the proportions of giants. Huge niches are set into the walls within which you can discern giant bones. Stern-looking statues of stone giants stand 20 feet tall against the walls, and in the center of the room lies a 15-foot-long sarcophagus.',
  'You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points while flowstone makes strange shapes on the floor.',
  'You push open the stone door to this room and note that the only other exit is a door made of wood. It and the table shoved against it are warped and swollen. Indeed, the table only barely deserves that description. Its surface is rippled into waves and one leg doesn\'t even touch the floor. The door shows signs of someone trying to chop through from the other side, but it looks like they gave up.',
  'You round the corner of the hall to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests. It seems someone set them up to barricade the hall. Three barrels are set up as seats near gaps in the barricade, no doubt the place where archers waited for foes. A rusting and torn breastplate hangs from a rope near the wall. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> Perhaps the breastplate served as a warning gong.',
  'You round the corner to see a ghastly scene. A semitranslucent figure hangs in the air, studded with crossbow bolts and with blood pouring from every wound. It reaches toward you in a pleading gesture, points to the walls on either side of the room, and then vanishes. Once it has gone, you notice small holes in the walls, each just large enough for a bolt to pass through.',
  'You smelled smoke as you moved down the hall, and rounding the corner into this room you see why. Every surface bears scorch marks and ash piles on the floor. The room reeks of fire and burnt flesh. Either a great battle happened here or the room bears some fire danger you cannot see for no flames light the room anymore.',
  'You\'ve opened the door to a torture chamber. Several devices of degradation, pain, and death stand about the room, all of them showing signs of regular use. The wood of the rack is worn smooth by struggling bodies, and the iron maiden appears to be occupied by a corpse.',
