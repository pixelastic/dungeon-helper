  'A crack in the ceiling above the middle of the north wall allows a trickle of water to flow down to the floor. The water pools near the base of the wall, and a rivulet runs along the wall an out into the hall. The water smells fresh.',
  'Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you can barely feel. One corner of the ceiling has a particularly large clot of webbing within which a goblin\'s bones are tangled.',
  'Tapestries decorate the walls of this room. Although they may once have been brilliant in hue, they now hang in graying tatters. Despite the damage of time and neglect, you can perceive once-grand images of wizards\' towers, magical beasts, and symbols of spellcasting. The tapestry that is in the best condition bulges out weirdly, as though someone stands behind it (an armless statue of a female human spellcaster).',
  'Rats inside the room shriek when they hear the door open, then they run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the floor. As these creatures crowd around the edges of the room, seeking to crawl through a hole in one corner, they fight one another. The stinking corpse in the middle of the room looks human, but the damage both time and the rats have wrought are enough to make determining its race by appearance an extremely difficult task at best.',
  'Neither light nor darkvision can penetrate the gloom in this chamber. An unnatural shade fills it, and the room\'s farthest reaches are barely visible. Near the room\'s center, you can just barely perceive a lump about the size of a human lying on the floor. (It might be a dead body, a pile of rags, or a sleeping monster that can take advantage of the room\'s darkness.) <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The darkness can come from a deeper darkness spell effect.',
  'Burning torches in iron sconces line the walls of this room, lighting it brilliantly. At the room\'s center lies a squat stone altar, its top covered in recently spilled blood. A channel in the altar funnels the blood down its side to the floor where it fills grooves in the floor that trace some kind of pattern or symbol around the altar. Unfortunately, you can\'t tell what it is from your vantage point.',
  'A liquid-filled pit extends to every wall of this chamber. The liquid lies about 10 feet below your feet and is so murky that you can\'t see its bottom. The room smells sour. A rope bridge extends from your door to the room\'s other exit.',
  'Fire crackles and pops in a small cooking fire set in the center of the room. The smoke from a burning rat on a spit curls up through a hole in the ceiling. Around the fire lie several fur blankets and a bag. It looks like someone camped here until not long ago, but then left in a hurry.',
  'A flurry of bats suddenly flaps through the doorway, their screeching barely audible as they careen past your heads. They flap past you into the rooms and halls beyond. The room from which they came seems barren at first glance.',
  'Rusting spikes line the walls and ceiling of this chamber. The dusty floor shows no sign that the walls move over it, but you can see the skeleton of some humanoid impaled on some wall spikes nearby.',
  'You open the door, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose. Looking inside, you see a pile of refuse and offal that nearly reaches the ceiling. In the ceiling above it is a small hole that is roughly as wide as two human hands. No doubt some city dweller high above disposes of his rubbish without ever thinking about where it goes.',
  'You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn\'t so inviting. The floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. It looks like the room once held a bed, a desk, a chest, and a chair.',
  'A skeleton dressed in moth-eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now-open lock. Dust coats something sticky on the needles\' points.',
  'Rounded green stones set in the floor form a snake\'s head that points in the direction of the doorway you stand in. The body of the snake flows back and toward the wall to go round about the room in ever smaller circles, creating a spiral pattern on the floor. Similar green-stone snakes wend along the walls, seemingly at random heights, and their long bodies make wave shapes.',
  'The manacles set into the walls of this room give you the distinct impression that it was used as a prison and torture chamber, although you can see no evidence of torture devices. One particularly large set of manacles -- big enough for an ogre -- have been broken open.',
  'You gaze into the room and hundreds of skulls gaze coldly back at you. They\'re set in niches in the walls in a checkerboard pattern, each skull bearing a half-melted candle on its head. The grinning bones stare vacantly into the room, which otherwise seems empty.',
  'Unlike the flagstone common throughout the dungeon, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white. The ceiling is similarly marbled, but the thick pillars that hold it up are white. A brown stain drips down one side of a nearby pillar. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The stain could be old blood.',
  'A huge iron cage lies on its side in this room, and its gate rests open on the floor. A broken chain lies under the door, and the cage is on a rotting corpse that looks to be a hobgoblin. Another corpse lies a short distance away from the cage. It lacks a head.',
  'This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state. In their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up by six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful woman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors is skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor must have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman.',
  'A dim bluish light suffuses this chamber, its source obvious at a glance. Blue-glowing lichen and violet-glowing moss cling to the ceiling and spread across the floor. It even creeps down and up each wall, as if the colonies on the floor and ceiling are growing to meet each other. Their source seems to be a glowing, narrow crack in the ceiling, the extent of which you cannot gauge from your position. The air in the room smells fresh and damp.',
  'You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and each hole is roughly a foot wide. The water pours in columns that fall through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to some unknown depth. Each of the eight pillars of water drops as much liquid as a stream in winter thaw. The floor is damp and looks slippery.',
  'This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling and spread across the floor. The slime seeps from the shattered stone of the ceiling at a snails crawl, forming a mess of dangling walls of gook. As you watch, a bit of the stuff separates from a sheet and drops to the ground with a wet plop.',
  'This room is hung with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of wear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years of neglect. They hang on all the walls and hang from the ceiling to brush against the floor, blocking your view of the rest of the room.',
  'You catch a whiff of the unmistakable metallic tang of blood as you open the door. The floor is covered with it, and splashes of blood spatter the walls. Some drops even reach the ceiling. It looks fresh, but you don\'t see any bodies or footprints leaving the chamber.',
  'Three low, oblong piles of rubble lie near the center of this small room. Each has a weapon jutting upright from one end -- a longsword, a spear, and a quarterstaff. The piles resemble cairns used to bury dead adventurers.',
  'Huge rusted metal blades jut out of cracks in the walls, and rusting spikes project down from the ceiling almost to the floor. This room may have once been trapped heavily, but someone triggered them, apparently without getting killed. The traps were never reset and now seem rusted in place.',
  'Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears about 20 feet deep. A lattice of thick iron bars covers the top of each pit, and each lattice has a door of iron bars that can be lifted open. The pits smell of sweat and offal, but the room seems unoccupied.',
  'Many doors fill the room ahead. Doors of varied shape, size, and design are set in every wall and even the ceiling and floor. Barely a hand\'s width lies between one door and the next. All the doors but the one you entered by are shut, and many have obvious locks.',
  'A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It\'s honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as wide as your head. They seem to penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but you can\'t be sure from your vantage point.',
  'This chamber was clearly smaller at one time, but something knocked down the wall that separated it from an adjacent room. Looking into that space, you see signs of another wall knocked over. It doesn\'t appear that anyone made an effort to clean up the rubble, but some paths through see more usage than others.',
  'A chill wind blows against you as you open the door. Beyond it, you see that the floor and ceiling are nothing but iron grates. Above and below the grates the walls extend up and down with no true ceiling or floor within your range of vision. It\'s as though the chamber is a bridge through the shaft of a great well. Standing on the edge of this shaft, you feel a chill wind pass down it and over your shoulder into the hall beyond.',
  'This room is shattered. A huge crevasse shears the chamber in half, and the ground and ceilings are tilted away from it. It\'s as though the room was gripped in two enormous hands and broken like a loaf of bread. Someone has torn a tall stone door from its hinges somewhere else in the dungeon and used it to bridge the 15-foot gap of the chasm between the two sides of the room. Whatever did that must have possessed tremendous strength because the door is huge, and the enormous hinges look bent and mangled.',
  'A pit yawns open before you just on the other side of the door\'s threshold. The entire floor of the room has fallen into a second room beneath it. Across the way you can spy a door in the wall now 15 feet off the rubble-strewn floor, and near the center of the room stands a thick column of mortared stone that appears to hold the spiral staircase that leads down to what was the lower level.',
  'As the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a floor covered in ice. The room before you looks like an ice cave. A tunnel wends its way through solid ice, and huge icicles and pillars of frozen water block your vision of its farthest reaches.',
  'A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns merrily in a wide brazier the idol holds in its lap.',
  'Several exits lead from this room, but only one is within the mouth of a man. The door opposite you stands within an intricate stone carving of a man\'s wide-open mouth. The man\'s nose and eyes loom over the door while his sculpted hair splays out across the wall on either side.',
  'The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream. Three tables bend beneath a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping. Several bookshelves stand nearby stuffed to overfilling with a jumble of books, jars, bottles, bags, and boxes. The alchemist who set this all up doesn\'t seem to be present, but a beaker of green fluid boils over a burner on one of the tables.',
  'The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and shattered wood grows white fungus.',
  'Several white marble busts that rest on white pillars dominate this room. Most appear to be male or female humans of middle age, but one clearly bears small horns projecting from its forehead and another is spread across the floor in a thousand pieces, leaving one pillar empty.',
  'A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks a head and stands in a posture of action or defense. All are garbed for battle. It\'s difficult to tell for sure without their heads, but two appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six appear human, and the rest look like they might be orcs.',
  'A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly blocked by portcullises. Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the floor in the room against the walls. They seem in poses of repose rather than violence.',
  'This tiny room holds a curious array of machinery. Winches and levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle from the ceiling. On a nearby wall, you note a pictogram of what looks like a scythe on a chain. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This room may be a control center for traps elsewhere in the dungeon.',
  'This narrow room at first appears to be a dead-end corridor, but then you note several metal plates on the walls set at about eye height. Looking more closely, you see that one of these plates is slid aside to reveal a peephole.',
  'You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and victors stripped them of their valuables.',
  'The door in front of you seems to be stuck. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs yank it open, it comes open. Read the following: A furious rumble resounds in the area as stones come clattering through the doorway, along with a thick cloud of rock dust. The room beyond is filled with rubble.',
  'This chamber served as an armory for some group of creatures. Armor and weapon racks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor. It hasn\'t been used in a long time, and all the useful weapons have been taken but for a single sword. Unlike the other weapons in the room, this one gleams untarnished in the light.',
  'There\'s a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.',
  'A horrendous, overwhelming stench wafts from the room before you. Small cages containing small animals and large insects line the walls. Some of the creatures look sickly and alive but most are clearly dead. Their rotting corpses and the unclean cages no doubt result in the zoo\'s foul odor. A cat mews weakly from its cage, but the other creatures just silently shrink back into their filthy prisons.',
  'A cluster of low crates surrounds a barrel in the center of this chamber. Atop the barrel lies a stack of copper coins and two stacks of cards, one face up. Meanwhile, atop each crate rests a fan of five face-down playing cards. A thin layer of dust covers everything. Clearly someone meant to return to their game of cards.',
  'This chamber of well-laid stones holds a wide bas-relief of a pastoral scene. In it you see a mountain like Mount Waterdeep, except that Castle Waterdeep and the city are missing. Instead, a small fishing village is a short way from a walled complex with several tall towers.',
  'A stone throne stands on a foot-high circular dais in the center of this cold chamber. The throne and dais bear the simple adornments of patterns of crossed lines -- a pattern also employed around each door to the room.',
  'A wall that holds a seat with a hole in it is in this chamber. It\'s a privy! The noisome stench from the hole leads you to believe that the privy sees regular use.',
  'The burble of water reaches your ears after you open the door to this room. You see the source of the noise in the far wall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with the figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.',
  'This room holds six dry circular basins large enough to hold a man and a dry fountain at its center. All possess chipped carvings of merfolk and other sea creatures. It looks like this room once served some group of people as a bath.',
  'A glow escapes this room through its open doorways. The masonry between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance. Glancing quickly about the room, you note that each stone bears the carving of someone\'s name. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Consider putting the name of one of your party\'s characters on the wall.',
  'A huge stewpot hangs from a thick iron tripod over a crackling fire in the center of this chamber. A hole in the ceiling allows some of the smoke from the fire to escape, but much of it expands across the ceiling and rolls down to fill the room in a dark fog. Other details are difficult to make out, but some creature must be nearby, because it smells like a good soup is cooking.',
  'You\'ve opened the door to a torture chamber. Several devices of degradation, pain, and death stand about the room, all of them showing signs of regular use. The wood of the rack is worn smooth by struggling bodies, and the iron maiden appears to be occupied by a corpse.',
  'This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone.',
  'Corpses and pieces of corpses hang from hooks that dangle from chains attached to thick iron rings. Most appear humanoid but a few of the body parts appear more monstrous. You don\'t see any heads, hands, or feet -- all seem to have been chopped or torn off. Neither do you see any guts in the horrible array, but several thick leather sacks hang from hooks in the walls, and they are suspiciously wet and the leather looks extremely taut -- as if it\' under great strain.',
  'This small chamber seems divided into three parts. The first has several hooks on the walls from which hang dusty robes. An open curtain separates that space from the next, which has a dry basin set in the floor. Beyond that lies another parted curtain behind which you can see several straw mats in a semicircle pointing toward a statue of a dog-headed man. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The first part of the room may have been used for changing and cleaning feet before entering the room with the statue.',
  'When looking into this chamber, you\'re confronted by a thousand reflections of yourself looking back. Mirrored walls set at different angles fill the room. A path seems to wind through the mirrors, although you can\'t tell where it leads.',
  'A large forge squats against the far wall of this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a wide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt for use in pounding out shapes in hot metal. Other forge tools hang in racks nearby, and a barrel of water and bellows rest on the floor nearby.',
  'This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners\' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn\'t allow you to see the full extent of them all.',
  'You push open the stone door to this room and note that the only other exit is a door made of wood. It and the table shoved against it are warped and swollen. Indeed, the table only barely deserves that description. Its surface is rippled into waves and one leg doesn\'t even touch the floor. The door shows signs of someone trying to chop through from the other side, but it looks like they gave up.',
  'This otherwise bare room has one distinguishing feature. The stone around one of the other doors has been pulled over its edges, as though the rock were as soft as clay and could be moved with fingers. The stone of the door and wall seems hastily molded together.',
  'You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you\'re uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber. The wall was an illusion and whoever cast it must be nearby!',
  'You feel a sense of foreboding upon peering into this cavernous chamber. At its center lies a low heap of refuse, rubble, and bones atop which sit several huge broken eggshells. Judging by their shattered remains, the eggs were big enough to hold a crouching man, making you wonder how large -- and where -- the mother is.',
  'This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of a minotaur lies on the floor, its belly carved out. The creature\'s innards are largely missing, and yet you detect no other wounds. Bloody, froglike footprints track away from the corpse and out an open door.',
  'A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in stonework -- but given the themes represented, it might be better described as a requiem. Scenes of death, both violent and peaceful, appear on every wall framed by grinning skeletons and ghoulish forms in ragged cloaks.',
  'A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the floor. Looking into the room is like looking down on a forest. Tall tangles of fungus resemble forested hills, the barren floor looks like a plain between the woods, and even a trickle of water and a puddle of water that pools in a low spot bears a resemblance to a river and lake, respectively.',
  'You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points while flowstone makes strange shapes on the floor.',
  'You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor with the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight.',
  'This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. Two great feathered wings droop from its back, both sculpted to look broken. The statue is skillfully crafted.',
  'The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges. Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble tiles. Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the room along with some small reading tables.',
  'Many small desks with high-backed chairs stand in three long rows in this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted candle in a rusting tin candleholder. Everything is covered with dust. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The room could have been a scriptorium at some point.',
  'You round the corner to see a ghastly scene. A semitranslucent figure hangs in the air, studded with crossbow bolts and with blood pouring from every wound. It reaches toward you in a pleading gesture, points to the walls on either side of the room, and then vanishes. Once it has gone, you notice small holes in the walls, each just large enough for a bolt to pass through.',
  'You open the door and before you is a dragon\'s hoard of treasure. Coins cover every inch of the room, and jeweled objects of precious metal jut up from the money like glittering islands in a sea of gold. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Taking one step in the room alerts the PCs to the disappointing truth. Their feet pass silently through the illusion of the coins to strike the solid floor beneath.',
  'You open the door to reveal a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains. No other doors are in the room, and it appears the door you opened was created to blend in with the walls. Additionally, you see no ceiling. You must be at the bottom of a very deep spiked pit.',
  'You open the door to a long narrow room with a high ceiling. Three thick circles of wood rest on wooden stands. You\'re not certain what they are because you came into the room behind them. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs step in the room to get a better look, they see that each is painted with concentric circles marred by dozens of cuts into its surface. They\'re targets, and the PCs are on the wrong end of an archery range.',
  'You open the door to what must be a combat training room. Rough fighting circles are scratched into the surface of the floor. Wooden fighting dummies stand waiting for someone to attack them. A few punching bags hang from the ceiling. There\'s something peculiar about it all though. Every dummy is stocky and each has a bedraggled piece of leather hanging from its head that could be a long mask or a beard.',
  'This small room contains several pieces of well-polished wood furniture. Eight ornate, high-backed chairs surround a long oval table, and a side table stands next to the far exit. All bear delicate carvings of various shapes. One bears carvings of skulls and bones, another is carved with shields and magic circles, and a third is carved with shapes like flames and lightning strokes. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The eight chairs represent the eight schools of magic.',
  'The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone\'s wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish.',
  'Looking into this room, you note four pits in the floor. A wide square is nearest you, a triangular pit beyond it, and a little farther than both lie two circular pits. The room is rectangular nearest you but it widens into a larger rounded chamber starting just beyond the rectangular pit. You note that many flagstones, ceiling tiles, and wall blocks are carved with a skull emblem of some kind, whose dark openings emulate the layout of the pits. You\'ve opened a door in the \'chin\' and are looking up at the face.',
  'This room looks like it was designed by drow. Rusted metal tiles create a huge mosaic of a spider in the floor, and someone set up rusted gratings like draperies of webs. At the far end of the chamber, the carving of a spider squats on the floor. It\'s about 3 feet tall and seems molded into the floor. Beyond it stands tall double doors of stone, their surface covered in a glittering web of gold.',
  'You peer through the open doorway into a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved as tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest. Stone root systems crawl out into the floor and marble branches expand across the ceiling. You even note a few carvings of small birds and squirrels. Beautiful as they are, the sculpting doesn\'t appear elven, and it\'s nothing dwarves would carve.',
  'This small room is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls. The seats all have holes in their top, like a privy. Facing stones on the front of the benches prevent you from seeing how deep the holes go. It looks like a communal bathroom. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> The PCs may have heard that these are common in Chessenta, but that country is hundreds of miles to the east and south.',
  'In the center of this large room lies a 30-foot-wide round pit, its edges lined with rusting iron spikes. About 5 feet away from the pit\'s edge stand several stone semicircular benches. The scent of sweat and blood lingers, which makes the pit\'s resemblance to a fighting pit or gladiatorial arena even stronger.',
  'This room is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze doors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide. The double doors are peaked at their centers, but unlike many sets of double doors, their division isn\'t in the center. Instead, the crack between the doors resembles a crooked bolt of lightning, which a figure in a cloud carved in the stone above the door appears to be hurling. The lightning bolt strikes down roughly 2 feet to the right of center. The figure in the clouds is deliberately indistinct, but it appears male, having a beard and male proportions. The stroke of bronze electricity hits a tower that seems small compared to the figure. This tower cracks down the center, continuing the gap between the doors until it reaches the ground. To either side of the tower lie pastoral scenes of hillsides dotted with sheep. There doesn\'t appear to be a lock or handles.',
  'You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to the proportions of giants. Huge niches are set into the walls within which you can discern giant bones. Stern-looking statues of stone giants stand 20 feet tall against the walls, and in the center of the room lies a 15-foot-long sarcophagus.',
  'This chamber holds an odd contraption of metal and wood. It\'s a 20-foot-diameter circular platform that is tilted heavily to one side. Beneath it you can discern mechanisms that seem to attach to a large crank not far away. Above the platform hang metal weights on thin chains, which in turn are attached to discs and belts that are attached to other winches. It seems as though turning the winches turns and tilts the platform and sets the weights to moving. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This could be a training room for combat, but the PCs don\'t see any weapons inside. Certainly it would take a great deal of concentration to fight on the platform; perhaps it\'s a training room for monks or spellcasters.',
  'You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall. Above it stands a strange statue of a lobster-headed and clawed woman. The statue is nearly 15 feet tall and holds the lobster claws crossed over its naked breasts.',
  'Stinking smoke wafts up from braziers made of skulls set around the edges of this room. The walls bear scratch marks and lines of soot that form crude pictures and what looks like words in some language [Goblin]. To the left lies a pile of rubbish and rubble heaped into a crude dais. The dais has upon it an ironbound chest that has been painted with a goblinlike face. Furs and skins of unknown origin are strewn haphazardly about the floor before the dais.',
  'This small bare chamber holds nothing but a large ironbound chest, which is big enough for a man to fit in and bears a heavy iron lock. The floor has a layer of undisturbed dust upon it.',
  'This hall is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the floor is sticky with dried blood. It looks like the orcs and ogres were fighting. Some side was the victor but you\'re not sure which one. The bodies are largely stripped of valuables, but a few broken weapons jut from the slain or lie discarded on the floor.',
  'You round the corner of the hall to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests. It seems someone set them up to barricade the hall. Three barrels are set up as seats near gaps in the barricade, no doubt the place where archers waited for foes. A rusting and torn breastplate hangs from a rope near the wall. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> Perhaps the breastplate served as a warning gong.',
  'You smelled smoke as you moved down the hall, and rounding the corner into this room you see why. Every surface bears scorch marks and ash piles on the floor. The room reeks of fire and burnt flesh. Either a great battle happened here or the room bears some fire danger you cannot see for no flames light the room anymore.',
  'This hall stinks with the wet, pungent scent of mildew. Black mold grows in tangled veins across the walls and parts of the floor. Despite the smell, it looks like it might be safe to travel through. A path of stone clean of mold wends its way through the hallway.',
  'You open the door and a gout of flame rushes at your face. A wave of heat strikes you at the same time and light fills the hall. The room beyond the door is ablaze! An inferno engulfs the place, clinging to bare rock and burning without fuel.',
  'You peer into this room and spot the white orb of a skull lying on the floor. Suddenly a stone falls from the ceiling and smashes the skull to pieces. An instant later, another stone from the ceiling drops to strike the floor and shatter. You hear a low rumbling and cracking noise. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The ceiling caves in during the next round.',
  'Dozens of dead, winged beings lie scattered about the floor, each about the size of a cat. Their broken bodies are batlike and buglike at the same time. Each had two sets of bat wings, a long nose like a mosquito, and six legs, but many were split in half or had limbs or wings lopped off. Their forms are little more than dried husks now, and there\'s no sign of what killed them.',

  'Vestiary\n\nA room for storing clothes or dressing in.\n\n(stool, clothes (all), desk, mirror, pin, clothespin, clothing rack, chest of drawers, closet, chair, lamp, candles, perfume, oils, make-up)',
  'Vestibule\n\nThis is a space separating the interior and exterior of a building. It’s often a chamber, hallway or passage. It can also be used to mean any enclosed space forming an approach, bridge, or entrance to any other section or interior space.\n\n(arch, basket, cabinet, chest, pottery, shadow box, clock (mantle, grandfather, wall), drapery, mirror, bench, chair, table, cushion, desk, screen, shelves, quilt, shrine, lamps, flowers, ashtray, wall or shelf decorations (see “Things” under comprehensive list of things in rooms))',
  'Zoo\n\nThis room is a park or garden-like area where animals are kept in cages or large enclosures.\n\n(cages, bestiaries, dias, pedestal, walking paths, benches, statues) ',
  'LES FLAMMES DE KHAZLA\n\nDès que tous les guerriers sont entrés dans cette section de donjon, d\'énormes dalles coulissent et bloquent les portes de façon hermétique, emprisonnant les guerriers. Cherchant un moyen de s\'enfuir, ils trouvent de petites alcôves dans les murs, chacune contenant un petit brasier qui brûle sans aucune alimentation visible.  Pour que les dalles libèrent les portes, permettant au groupe de passer, un des guerriers doit plonger ses bras dans les deux brasiers.  Chaque guerrier ne peut essayer l\'épreuve qu\'une seule fois. Si tous les guerriers échouent, le groupe est bloqué pour les 72 prochaines heures et périt étouffé.',
  'EMPREINTES DE PAS\n\n Les guerriers repèrent des empreintes de pas dans la poussière qui mènent jusqu\'à un mur et disparaissent.',
  'ESCLAVES\n\n Les guerriers découvrent 2D6 esclaves enchaînes aux murs. Ils sont dans un triste état et donnent l\'impression de ne pas avoir été nourris depuis plusieurs jours. Ils implorent les guerriers de les libérer.',
  'ORQUE AGONISANT\n\n Les guerriers trouvent un orque agonisant sur le sol, victime d\'un combat entre clans. Bien qu\'il ait au moins une douzaine de blessures fatales, il parvient encore à grogner aux guerriers de ficher le camp. II semble protéger une lourde clé de fer qu\'il serre dans sa main.',
  'CHANGEMENT DE PLAN\n\n Une silhouette voûtée, portant un grand manteau, appairait furtivement, restant dans l\'ombre et se déplaçant dans un silence irréel. L\'homme s\'approche des guerriers et, après un coup d\'oeil théâtral pour s\'assurer de l\'absence d\'ennemis, leur dit dans un murmure : Mes amis, j\'apporte d\'importantes nouvelles. Vous devez abandonner votre quête car le danger est plus grand que vous ne l\'imaginiez.  Abandonnez cette tache et retournez d\'où vous venez. Vous recevrez chacun 750 pièces d\'or en compensation.',
  'PERDUS\n\n Après avoir erré dans le donjon pendant ce qui semble être des heures sans avoir rien vu d\'intéressant, les guerriers réalisent qu\'ils sont perdus.',
  'EBOULEMENT\n\n Alors que les guerriers entrent dans cette partie du donjon, le sol tremble, les murs vacillent et d\'énormes blocs de pierre tombent du plafond. Le donjon s\'écroule !  Les guerriers encore présents dans cette section de donjon à la fin du prochain tour sont écrasés par les décombres et tués.  La pièce est désormais infranchissable et il n\'est pas possible d\'y pénétrer à nouveau.',
  'OSSEMENTS\n\n Le sol de cette pièce est couvert d\'os et de crânes, et de l\'or brille sous ces ossements.',
  'LUMIERE DU JOUR\n\n Les guerriers remarquent une lumière venant d\'une fente au plafond, et après examen, découvrent l\'entrée d\'une cheminée.',
  'RUNES ORQUES\n\n Les guerriers remarquent des douzaines de runes orques grossièrement gravées sur le mur de cette pièce. ',
  'This room has grey stone walls, ceiling, and floor. There is a broken iron chandelier in the middle of it. The candles on the chandelier are only half burnt. There is a powerful echo in the room which amplifies all sounds made within.',
  'This room is completely black. Within the black are stars. Millions of stars. Stepping into the room one gets the uncanny impression of floating in deep space. It is however a perfectly normal room otherwise.',
  'The walls of this room are covered with ancient tapestries. They are rotten and full of carpet bugs. The floor is made of wood, which has somehow survived in perfectly pristine condition.',
  'This room is filled with doors of all shapes and sizes. There are even a few window frames, and one comfortable couch.',
  'This room has a checkerboard pattern on its floor in black and white, and a similar pattern on its ceiling in red and blue. Someone has left a mop in a bucket of soapy water near the entrance the party comes in from.',
  'This room is filled with sawdust. Walking into it stirs it and it begins to float around. The sawdust sticks to anything it touches, like sawdust does.',
  'This room is fully padded with a white soft material.',
  'There is an odd smell in this room, as if someone had recently been cooking there. However, the floor is polished clean marble and the walls and ceiling are perfectly white stone.',
  'This room feels friendly. It is decorated in a red rose pattern all throughout. There is a deck of playing cards on a rose patterned table here. The playing cards all depict different kinds of roses.',
  'The floor of this room is covered in images of feathers. The walls are painted with images of wildlife. The ceiling is one huge red sun.',
  'This room has a bouncy floor made of somekind of red material. The ceiling isn\'t low enough for anyone to bang their head on it by accident. Slashing at the material breaks it, and makes it useless for anything other than covering material.',
  'This room has several empty cubicles. There are windows on the walls, but they are empty and only show the wall they hang from.',
  'There are strange faraway sounds of people talking in this room. The sounds can not be deciphered. The room is completely empty.',
  'There is a sword practise doll made of wood affixed to the center of this room. It is full of cuts and scrapes. There are no swords anywhere.',
  'This room has about two thousand cardboard boxes. None of them contain anything, except perhaps more boxes.',
  'This room has two chests. They are made of lead, and apparently stuck to floor, as no-one will be able to lift them. One of them contains a doll which looks like a wizard, and the other one is empty. Searching the chest with the wizard doll uncovers a secret compartment. Inside it is a map. The map has several sections of the dungeon detailed, but only ones that the party has already been in.',
  'The walls of this room are full of text in red ink. The ink has worn out, and not one word is legible.',
  'This room contains a sword stand. There are five places for swords, but only two swords. The first is so used it has turned blunt, and the other is broken in half.',
  'This room has walls of dark jagged rock. The ceiling has been painted black. The paint is still wet, and it is slowly dripping down to the grey floor. It is possible to cross the room carefully so that the paint doesn\'t fall on you.',
  'The floor of this room is littered with the shards of thousands of bits of broken crockery. There doesn\'t seem to be any way to walk across without the bits crunching under foot.',
  'The ceiling of this room is an arching dome with hundreds of tiny round openings in it, apparently air vents or perhaps speaking tubes. Faint whispers can be heard as you pass, but they are so garbled together that it\'s impossible to make out what any are saying.',
  'The floor before you is sagging and cracked, as if the supports beneath it had been broken. (Balance check, DC 10 when crossing) There is a relatively clear path through, though not a straight one.',
  'The walls of this room are lined with book shelves, though where the books might be you have no clue. The shelves appear to have been recently dusted.11) This room feels too large for its size, as if someone had crammed a much larger room into the space it now occupies. There are green plants growing down from the ceiling. The ceiling looks to be made of soil, though none of it appears to be falling down.',
  'The walls of this room have been decorated with different coloured marble eyes. They all seem to stare at anyone entering, but this is only a feeling one gets.',
  'This room is dark. Really really dark. Any light source, magical or otherwise, which is brought into this room only illuminates it in a five foot radius. There is a human skeleton lying in the middle of the floor. It has a non-magical ring on its one remaining finger.',
  'This room contains a few dusty bathtubs. A couple of them are hooked up to pipes coming from the walls. All of them are dry, and nothing comes from the pipes if someone tries them.',
  'The floor of this room is covered in marble tiles. The tiles have different coloured numbers on them, but these seem completely random. Walking on any of the tiles makes them break, and the person who did so falls a half a feet down to the real floor (and receives no damage).',
  'Stepping into this room is like entering a desert during a high sun. The walls are a faded yellow, and the floor has a sandlike pattern. The ceiling is a bright white. Staying in this room for longer than 5 minutes makes you feel parched.',
  'This room eats all sounds. Nothing can be heard while within, and no sound can be made. There is a pedestal by the side of the room. On it is an emerald. If someone takes the emerald out of the room it breaks. Breaking the emerald dispels the sound eating effect.',
  'The floor of this room is wildly uneven. Standing on one side one gets the impression that the other side is impossibly small, and vice versa.',
  'This room makes everyone entering it feel claustrophobic. The walls feel like they are constantly closing in, and ceiling looks menacing. It\'s perfectly safe to be there.',
  'This room is a raging inferno of fire. It isn\'t magical, and it will hurt. The magical effect of the room is in keeping the fire contained inside it. Carefully and slowly walking into the room one will realize that there is a safe narrow path inside which will take you to the other exit(s).21) This room is oval in shape with no distinct corners. The floor feels gritty beneath your feet, and the walls are painted with a continuous fresco of a seascape that surrounds you. Oddly, you feel that if you stay here for any time you\'ll become seasick.',
  'The floor of this room is littered with pencils and partially finished sketches of the same beautiful woman. Each picture is missing a different part of her.',
  'The floor of this room is slightly damp. The room is entirely violet.',
  'This room feels ancient. It looks like the inside of a castle tower. Inspecting the stonework gives the impression that it once was an actual room in a castle tower which someone carried here piece by piece and then assembled in exactly the same way. There is a lavish bed here which would make even the haughtiest of princesses sigh with envy. The entrance(s) to the room were once locked, but the locks have rusted away.',
  'There is a golden statue of a terrifying demon in this room. The statue is much too big to be carried out, and the gold is fake.',
  'There are so many carpets of various kind on the floor of this room that simply getting into the room is a bit hard.',
  'This room is a library. All of the books are journals of a man named Ekhnaton. If anyone tries to read even one of them they will fall asleep. The journals are mindnumbingly boring. The sleep is non-magical, and waking the person is simple.',
  'This room contains a railroad which connects the entrances. There is a small minecart on the track near where the party comes in. The track is slightly rusted, and walking is faster than using the cart.',
  'The ceiling of this room is so low that to get through it the largest member of the party needs to bend down slightly.',
  'This room is completely empty save for a key on the floor near the opposite entrance.',
  'There are small cages in this room. In the cages are snakes. The snakes can easily escape through the bars if they so choose. The snakes are non-poisonous and harmless. There are lots of dead mice outside the cages.',
  'This room is a labyrinth of clear glass.',
  'This room is very muddy. There are several shovels and buckets in the mud.',
  'The doors, floor, ceiling, and walls of this room are all a mirror. Breaking a part of the mirror surface reveals small lockers all around the room. None of them are locked. They contain buttons, a couple of coins, needles, thread, tiny picture frames, non-magical rings and amulets, and all sorts of other knick knacks.',
  'This room is made of rusted iron. If one searches through the scrap on the floor he may find a usable hammer.',
  'This room is almost completely filled by an aquarium in the middle of it. There are plants living in it, but they have grown so thick that it is impossible to tell whether there is anything else living inside.',
  'This room looks like a living room, but there is no furniture in it, only outlines between gathering dust where furniture used be. The walls used to be full of paintings, but they\'ve been removed as well.',
  'This room is filled with burning candles, but they do not seem to be burning down. Extinguishing one extinguishes all of them, and none of them can no longer be lit after that.',
  'In this room there is a strong wind. The wind always seems to be against the direction one is travelling, and all movement speeds are halved while here.',
  'This room has a puzzle floor. The floor tiles are on a track, and can be moved around. Moving them into the correct pattern makes them form a picture of a shadowy creature hiding behind a faraway tree on a grassy knoll. After completing the picture a secret compartment opens up on one of the walls with a loud click. Inside is a spyglass.',
  'This room has been painted in tiger stripes. It contains a drum set.',
  'This room looks like the storage room of a ceramics shop. There are shelves full of all kids of plates, mugs, teapots, kettles, pots, pans, jugs, and the like.',
  'There is a monkey in this room. When the party enters, the monkey says \'Ug?\' and runs away. There are banana peels on the floor.',
  'This room contains a library, but all of the books are empty. None of them even have titles.',
  'This room has a black and white checkerboard pattern on the floor, and is separated into several sections by large red curtains. Each section is somehow soundproof so that no sound passes to the others sections.36) This room is decorated like the inside of an arabian tent. The beautiful fabrics used as decoration each have their own exotic scent, as if someone had been collecting perfumes from all around the world and then sprayed them randomly everywhere. On the floor are several chairs, an empty table, and a chest full of empty perfume bottles.',
  'This room is a mess. Empty wine bottles litter the floor. Chairs and tables have been thrown about as if there was a fight. There\'s cutlery and scraps of food everywhere.',
  'This room contains a cobble stone floor and a well. The well is deep and dark. There is a winch for a bucket which is down below. Using the winch to bring the bucket up reveals it and the bottom of the well to be full of black sand.',
  'There are small grates on the sides of this room, from which float tiny sweet smelling bubbles, which frequently pop loudly.',
  'This room looks like the ransacked laboratory of a wizard. Everything in it has been torn apart, smashed to pieces, and broken violently. Searching through the wreckage one can find a couple of random first level scrolls.',
  'There are three small birds in this room. They fly around, apparently playing with each other and completely ignoring everything else. Trying to interact with them reveals them to be harmless ghost birds.',
  'This blue painted room has a staircase in the middle, which seems to lead nowhere. Climbing the staircase takes one to another room, which has been painted red. The red room contains several sleeping bags and blankets.',
  'The walls of this room have pictures of weird animals. Horses with human heads. Donkeys with dragon wings. Gigantic insects attacking a castle. Lizards with chicken legs. A cuckoo bird the size of an elephant being ridden by a minotaur. Dogs with horns headbutting each other. A cat with three tails.',
  'This room looks like a courtyard. There are two fountains here spewing dirty water at each other.',
  'This room contains numerous slowly melting ice sculptures. It\'s hard to tell what any of them used to look like.51) There is a mist crawling across the floor of this room. It moves like a wild sea. Above the mist hang tiny clouds of smoke. Kneeling into the mist one gets the impression of being underwater.',
  'There is a rug on the floor of this room. The rug resembles very high grass, and wading through it is difficult.',
  'This room contains a series of jail cells. None of them are locked. One contains an old leather armor.',
  'This room has laundry hanging from wires strung across it. All of the clothing is that of a highborn lady. All of it is freshly washed. There are empty wicker baskets on the floor.',
  'There is a bloodtrail on the floor of this room. The trail is in a spiral pattern from the entrance to the center of the room. If someone follows the pattern all the way to the center it vanishes and is replaced with red string. At the end of the string there is an amulet with a lion crest.',
  'There are dancing shadows in this room. They stalk each other across the walls and one by one kill each other. This repeats over and over.',
  'An underground river runs into and out of this room. The room is made of dark stone. There is a rickety wooden bridge leading across the river. On each side of the river are sturdy steel grates through which it flows.',
  'This room has been completely painted with a sparkly blue and white pattern. It is so sparkly one has to squint hard to be able to even leave the room. ',
  'In this room there is what looks like a gigantic mouse trap. When the party enters it activates, and completely breaks down without harming anyone. The mechanism looks to have been chewed on by rats.',
  'The floor of this room is made of countless bamboo rings. There are empty paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. On the walls are samurai swords. Inspecting the swords reveals them to be very high class replicas, useless for combat.',
  'There are several not so neat rows of school desks and chairs in this room. In front of them is a large blackboard. Written on the blackboard with chalk are extremely basic fighting manouvers, like \'Hit the enemy with your sword\', \'Block attacks with your shield\', \'Protect the Wizard\', \'When wounded have the cleric heal you\'. There are also diagrams illustrating these manouvers.',
  'In this room there is a huge mechanical steampower clock. There are pipes running from it into the ceiling. The clock is counting backwards. Everytime it reaches a full minute it makes a train-like choo choo sound. When it reaches a full hour its boiler begins to work overtime, turning the room briefly boiler room hot and very steamy. Then it continues counting backwards. This is all it ever does.',
  'This room is painted in a zebra pattern. There is a hat with brightly coloured feathers sticking from it on a shelf by the opposite entrance. If someone picks up the hat the sound of flute music is heard from somewhere beyond the room.',
  'There are three grand pianos in this room. On the walls are blue velvet curtains. On the ceiling is a copper chandelier, lit by surprisingly huge candles. If one tries playing the pianos he discovers that they are tuned in different ways. One sounds almost dainty, one plays somber sad sounds, and the third can only do grim dark, regardless of the song played.',
  'In this room there is the aftermath of a recently fought battle. When the party enters the room they will suddenly realize that the entrance they used was actually a wall someone hacked through with a battlexe. The other entrance(s) had been barricaded with various furniture. The barricade on the opposite side has been cast aside as if someone immensely strong charged into it. The room used to look like a barracks, but everything in it is in shambles. The markings suggest numerous people fought here, but only two are still in the room. A highborn lady is slumped against a writing desk, her skull cracked. Near her on the floor is a dying man dressed like a wizard. If someone from the party approaches him he will whisper \'Tell them, my name was, Ekhnaton..\' and then he will die. There is an odd resonating vibration in the air near both of the bodies. If someone tries bringing either of them back from the dead they will turn into ancient skeletons instead (you could have a combat encounter here). ',
  'In this room are a couple of planks of wood. There are signs which suggest that the room may once have been filled with them.',
  'When the party enters this room a monkey will peek into it from another entrance. Then it runs away. There is nothing here.',
  'This room is filled with broken machinery. In the corner of the room there is a cubicle inside which is a bathroom with a working steampower toilet, and a sink with a tap which produces a trickle of fresh water.',
  'This is a kitchen. There are no kitchen implements anywhere, and not one scrap of food. All of the cupboards are empty, all of the tables are clean. There are candlestands here, but no candles.',
  'This room contains several baskets of dirty clothing.',
  'This room is a pool. There\'s no water. In the pool is a rope ten feet long, and a fallen ladder large enough for someone to climb out of it.',
  'In this room is a rabbit with a small hat. It\'s a friendly little rabbit, and starts hopping towards the party when they enter. Someone has recently left a basket of vegetables here. There are also three clearly visible, but unrelated, elven skeletal remains in the corner of the room. ',
  'Through the middle of this room runs a moat. The moat is six feet deep and two feet wide. In the moat is a pickaxe. There\'s no sign of where the soil from the moat or the floor tiles from its spot have been taken to.',
  'This room has a grass floor. There are some flowers growing in it.',
  'This is clearly a throne room, but someone has taken the throne. This is the feeling the party gets, but it is verified by the picture on the wall where the throne still stands.',
  'The doors into this room are heavy iron, and extremely hard to open. It looks like a graveyard, but all of the graves are empty. Only the headstones remain, but they are too old for anyone to read the inscriptions. The walls have been painted with the image of a vast graveyard.',
  'This room is a garish yellow. There\'s a table with a candlestand in the corner. On the table is an inkwell, a fountain pen, and a half-finished note. The note reads \'This is it. They want us to leave this place. We are going to have to take a stand. Some of the others have already begun to\'.',
  'This room has a cracked ceiling support. The ceiling has caved in, and there is just about enough room by the sides for the party to pass through.',
  'The entrances to this room have been covered with floral pattern curtains. The room itself is boringly grey. There\'s a large loom here, and several spools of different kinds of thread. In the corner is a basket with a couple of warm shirts.',
  'Opening the doors to this room is difficult. It\'s as if they are fighting back. When the party enters all of the doors slam shut. There\'s a strong draft here which leads to a grate in the ceiling. Leaving the room is as hard, and as easy, as entering.71) This room has reversed gravity, but the ceiling is padded with a soft material, and there are stairs leading back down to the entrances. There is a normal dagger somehow lying on the floor (without falling to the ceiling).',
  'The rubble from a broken stalagmite covers the floor, nearby to its stump that yet juts up from the floor.',
  'A single booted footprint on the muddy floor betrays the passage of previous explorers.',
  'Rubble covers the floor throughout this area, except for an obvious path which has been cleared. Piles of rubble flank the pathway, creating areas difficult to move through.',
  'Mud covers the floor and water drips from the ceiling above. The mud hides several deep hollows in the floor which could trip unwary explorers.',
  'The faint scent of burnt flesh reaches the party’s nostrils.',
  'Luminescent fungi grows high up on one wall. Its faint glow reveals the presence of a narrow passageway slanting steeply upwards.',
  'A narrow fissure little more than a foot wide splits the floor in twain. A faint breeze emanates from below.',
  'Three splintered crossbow bolts lie about the floor. None have any blood on their points.',
  'A rocky outcrop on one wall looks a little like a melted giant’s face emerging from the rock, in the party’s flickering lights.',
  'Water drips from a crack in the ceiling creating a curtain blocking further progress. The curtain blocks vision of what lies beyond, and the sound of dripping water inflicts a -2 penalty to Perception checks.',
  'A cracked skull yet wearing a battered iron helm sits in a small hole in one wall. Its seems to watch those passing by…',
  'Stalagmites and stalactites fill a low grotto to one side of the passageway. Shadows cluster thickly within, providing a perfect spot for an ambush.',
  'A large, almost man-sized, mushroom once dominated this area. However, someone has recently hacked the mushroom down and its remains now lie mouldering near its low stump.',
  'The sound of soft laugher followed by the soft clatter of shifting rocks comes from somewhere ahead.',
  'A wide stream of clear, fresh water runs through the area. Several stones placed several feet apart provide a convenient means of crossing the steam while keeping one’s feet dry.',
  'Bats nest in the roof. A party bringing lights into the area disturbs them. They flutter about until the light source is removed.',
  'Thick webs fill this area. A faint breeze issues from cracks in the rock causing the webs to gently undulate.',
  'Thick mud covers the cavern floor. A discarded spade lies near a partially dug grave. A thick brown sludge of mud and water fills the grave to a depth of about one foot. It is otherwise empty.',
  'Translucent crystals stud the cavern walls. Introducing a light source into the cavern creates a riot of colour. Crystals harvested from the walls shatter and are valueless.',
  'The haft of a pickaxe lies in the floor. Nearby, the rest of it is embedded in a wall.',
  'A bucket filled with rubble stands against one wall. Stuffed between it and the wall is a shard of seemingly unremarkable rock wrapped in a dirty sack.',
  'An (inanimate) skeletal arm clad in rags emerges from a caved in section of tunnel.',
  'At this point in the tunnel, a mine cart lies on its side. It partially blocks the tunnel and rubble lies all about.',
  'Water drips down from the ceiling forming a small pool on the floor.',
  'One of the wooden roof supports has collapsed and fallen to the ground. Ominously, a small pile of rubble lies around the fallen support perhaps hints the roof is unstable.',
  'An iron bar gate blocks off access to a side tunnel. The gate is old and its lock is rusted into immobility. Beyond the passageway extends 10 ft., before turning away to the east.',
  'Minerals in the tunnel’s walls glimmer in the party’s lights. They are worthless, but pretty nonetheless.',
  'A sinkhole pierces the passage’s floor blocking further progress. The sinkhole is 5 ft. wide and 120 ft. deep. Danger lurks here for the far side of the sinkhole is unstable; anyone jumping across and landing within 5 ft of the edge causes an additional collapse, which drops unfortunate adventurers into the lightless depths below.',
  'Phosperescent mould grows along one wall and part of the ceiling. The mould is green and harmless. Observant adventurers notice it seems to undulate gently. (Its thick growth obscures several small worked holes in the wall that lead to an air shaft).',
  'A barrel full of rusting mining equipment—picks, spades etc.—stands in an alcove. The equipment is worthless, and rapidly falls apart if put to its intended use.',
  'A shaft pierces the ceiling. It extends upward linking up with an upper level. A faint cold breeze issues from the shaft and—occasionally—strange sounds are also discernable.',
  'From somewhere far away comes the sounds of miners at work. Later, the party come across an area of tunnel in which the air is full of rock dust. Of the miners, there is no sign.',
  'A rotting chest stands in an alcove. Within linger the remains of rations and several desiccated water flasks.',
  'The skeletal remains of a pony lie in front of an overturned mine cart. The cart partially blocks the passageway and examination of the skeleton reveals the animal likely broke a leg and was left here to die.',
  'Deep cracks pierce the ceiling of a large section of tunnel. As the PCs approach the area, the rocks groan alarmingly and dust sifts down from above.',
  'Thick spider webs cover the entrance to a side tunnel. A faint, but unpleasant, smell emerges from the tunnel. The spider is long dead, but the desiccated remains of its victims yet remain.',
  'A ripped and torn backpack lies in the deep dust covering the floor. Dried blood covers the back portion of the pack (which is empty).',
  'Here, the miners carved several niches in the tunnel wall and filled them with candles and votive offerings to the various gods of the underworld. All are covered in dust but, along with many partially burnt candles, looters can recover 15 gp in old mixed coinage.',
  'Up head, the tunnel splits in two and goes around a large column of tremendously dense rock. A whitewashed arrow points down one tunnel.Here, water oozes down the walls from above leaving tracks on the ancient brickwork. On the ground, the water has turned the dust into thick paste-like grey ooze.',
  'Dusty cobwebs fill the corners of the ceiling.',
  'A small portion of brickwork from one wall has fallen away revealing the bare rock behind. A low pile of rubble lies on the floor nearby.',
  'Dust sifts down from the archway over a door. The stones of the arch have shifted and consequently the door is harder than normal to force open. If the door is opened, the stones above groan ominously and dust sift down into the doorway…',
  'Incongruously, a single bone—a thighbone—lies on the floor in front of a shadowy archway.',
  'The walls here were once decorated with brightly painted images painted directly onto the smooth stone. The colours have long since faded, and now only a suggestion of what once was remains.',
  'A section of floor is bumpy and uneven, making rapid movement difficult. The paving slabs can be easily pried up, but nothing of interest lies beneath.',
  'A pillar once held up the roof here, but at some point in the distant past it collapsed. Dust shrouds the resultant pile of rubble; the ceiling over the rubble sags dangerously.',
  'Several niches that once contained offerings to those buried here pierce the walls. All have succumbed to time’s remorseless advance and are now nothing more than small piles of rotting, rusting or desiccated remains.',
  'Huge religious symbols appropriate to the faith who built the crypt have been carved into the walls. Dust and cobwebs shroud portions of the carvings. Tracing the grandest of the carvings with one’s hand deactivates a nearby trap.',
  'Statues of the faithful garbed for war stand guard over this area. Half have serene looks upon their faces while the others’ faces are twisted with hate. The statues are arrayed so they all look towards the entrance.',
  'Niches cut into the wall each hold the shrouded skeletons of long-dead worshippers. Dust, cobwebs and other detritus cover the remains. The densely packed niches run from floor to ceiling. An ornate shroud edged with silver and gold thread covers the corpse in one of the particularly inaccessible niche near the ceiling.',
  'Several small holes pierce the wall at ground level. Small dried faeces—typical of that left by rats, mice or other rodents—covers the floor.',
  'Small holes in the ceiling emit a faint cold breeze into the chamber. The constant draught stirs the dust covering the floor. Paranoid explorers may think some form of invisible guardian lurks within the dust cloud.',
  'Carved holy symbols decorate the walls of this area. Several have been deliberately defaced, but there seems to be no obvious reason for this deliberate vandalism.',
  'A faded mosaic covers the floor. It depicts a stylised representation of the afterlife, but exact details are hard to pick out as some of the tiles are cracked and others are missing.',
  'Several burial niches in this area are empty. In all cases, discarded burial shrouds lie in the niche or nearby. Have the remains been removed or are they lurking animate guardians of the complex?',
  'A narrow ventilation shaft cut into the ceiling allows a thin ray of pale light into the crypt.',
  'Burial niches pierce the walls of the area (see #12 above). The remains of one of the interred have fallen from its niche and lies draped on the floor nearby.',
  'Cockroaches and other insects once infested this crypt. Feasting on the remains of those interred here they grew fat and numerous, but when they ran out of food they died off. Now their desiccated remains coat the floor and make moving quietly difficult (as they crunch underfoot).'
