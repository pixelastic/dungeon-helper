Ce petit morveux sournois pousse un cri à chaque fois que les guerriers entrent dans une salle, pour avertir quelqu\'un sans doute, mais qui ?

exports.default = ['A crack in the ceiling above the middle of the north wall allows a trickle of water to flow down to the floor. The water pools near the base of the wall, and a rivulet runs along the wall an out into the hall. The water smells fresh.', 'Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you can barely feel. One corner of the ceiling has a particularly large clot of webbing within which a goblin\'s bones are tangled.', 'Tapestries decorate the walls of this room. Although they may once have been brilliant in hue, they now hang in graying tatters. Despite the damage of time and neglect, you can perceive once-grand images of wizards\' towers, magical beasts, and symbols of spellcasting. The tapestry that is in the best condition bulges out weirdly, as though someone stands behind it (an armless statue of a female human spellcaster).', 'Rats inside the room shriek when they hear the door open, then they run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the floor. As these creatures crowd around the edges of the room, seeking to crawl through a hole in one corner, they fight one another. The stinking corpse in the middle of the room looks human, but the damage both time and the rats have wrought are enough to make determining its race by appearance an extremely difficult task at best.', 'Neither light nor darkvision can penetrate the gloom in this chamber. An unnatural shade fills it, and the room\'s farthest reaches are barely visible. Near the room\'s center, you can just barely perceive a lump about the size of a human lying on the floor. (It might be a dead body, a pile of rags, or a sleeping monster that can take advantage of the room\'s darkness.) <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The darkness can come from a deeper darkness spell effect.', 'Burning torches in iron sconces line the walls of this room, lighting it brilliantly. At the room\'s center lies a squat stone altar, its top covered in recently spilled blood. A channel in the altar funnels the blood down its side to the floor where it fills grooves in the floor that trace some kind of pattern or symbol around the altar. Unfortunately, you can\'t tell what it is from your vantage point.', 'A liquid-filled pit extends to every wall of this chamber. The liquid lies about 10 feet below your feet and is so murky that you can\'t see its bottom. The room smells sour. A rope bridge extends from your door to the room\'s other exit.', 'Fire crackles and pops in a small cooking fire set in the center of the room. The smoke from a burning rat on a spit curls up through a hole in the ceiling. Around the fire lie several fur blankets and a bag. It looks like someone camped here until not long ago, but then left in a hurry.', 'A flurry of bats suddenly flaps through the doorway, their screeching barely audible as they careen past your heads. They flap past you into the rooms and halls beyond. The room from which they came seems barren at first glance.', 'Rusting spikes line the walls and ceiling of this chamber. The dusty floor shows no sign that the walls move over it, but you can see the skeleton of some humanoid impaled on some wall spikes nearby.', 'You open the door, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose. Looking inside, you see a pile of refuse and offal that nearly reaches the ceiling. In the ceiling above it is a small hole that is roughly as wide as two human hands. No doubt some city dweller high above disposes of his rubbish without ever thinking about where it goes.', 'You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn\'t so inviting. The floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. It looks like the room once held a bed, a desk, a chest, and a chair.', 'A skeleton dressed in moth-eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now-open lock. Dust coats something sticky on the needles\' points.', 'Rounded green stones set in the floor form a snake\'s head that points in the direction of the doorway you stand in. The body of the snake flows back and toward the wall to go round about the room in ever smaller circles, creating a spiral pattern on the floor. Similar green-stone snakes wend along the walls, seemingly at random heights, and their long bodies make wave shapes.', 'The manacles set into the walls of this room give you the distinct impression that it was used as a prison and torture chamber, although you can see no evidence of torture devices. One particularly large set of manacles -- big enough for an ogre -- have been broken open.', 'You gaze into the room and hundreds of skulls gaze coldly back at you. They\'re set in niches in the walls in a checkerboard pattern, each skull bearing a half-melted candle on its head. The grinning bones stare vacantly into the room, which otherwise seems empty.', 'Unlike the flagstone common throughout the dungeon, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white. The ceiling is similarly marbled, but the thick pillars that hold it up are white. A brown stain drips down one side of a nearby pillar. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The stain could be old blood.', 'A huge iron cage lies on its side in this room, and its gate rests open on the floor. A broken chain lies under the door, and the cage is on a rotting corpse that looks to be a hobgoblin. Another corpse lies a short distance away from the cage. It lacks a head.', 'This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state. In their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up by six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful woman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors is skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor must have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman.', 'A dim bluish light suffuses this chamber, its source obvious at a glance. Blue-glowing lichen and violet-glowing moss cling to the ceiling and spread across the floor. It even creeps down and up each wall, as if the colonies on the floor and ceiling are growing to meet each other. Their source seems to be a glowing, narrow crack in the ceiling, the extent of which you cannot gauge from your position. The air in the room smells fresh and damp.', 'You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and each hole is roughly a foot wide. The water pours in columns that fall through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to some unknown depth. Each of the eight pillars of water drops as much liquid as a stream in winter thaw. The floor is damp and looks slippery.', 'This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling and spread across the floor. The slime seeps from the shattered stone of the ceiling at a snails crawl, forming a mess of dangling walls of gook. As you watch, a bit of the stuff separates from a sheet and drops to the ground with a wet plop.', 'This room is hung with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of wear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years of neglect. They hang on all the walls and hang from the ceiling to brush against the floor, blocking your view of the rest of the room.', 'You catch a whiff of the unmistakable metallic tang of blood as you open the door. The floor is covered with it, and splashes of blood spatter the walls. Some drops even reach the ceiling. It looks fresh, but you don\'t see any bodies or footprints leaving the chamber.', 'Three low, oblong piles of rubble lie near the center of this small room. Each has a weapon jutting upright from one end -- a longsword, a spear, and a quarterstaff. The piles resemble cairns used to bury dead adventurers.', 'Huge rusted metal blades jut out of cracks in the walls, and rusting spikes project down from the ceiling almost to the floor. This room may have once been trapped heavily, but someone triggered them, apparently without getting killed. The traps were never reset and now seem rusted in place.', 'Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears about 20 feet deep. A lattice of thick iron bars covers the top of each pit, and each lattice has a door of iron bars that can be lifted open. The pits smell of sweat and offal, but the room seems unoccupied.', 'Many doors fill the room ahead. Doors of varied shape, size, and design are set in every wall and even the ceiling and floor. Barely a hand\'s width lies between one door and the next. All the doors but the one you entered by are shut, and many have obvious locks.', 'A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It\'s honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as wide as your head. They seem to penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but you can\'t be sure from your vantage point.', 'This chamber was clearly smaller at one time, but something knocked down the wall that separated it from an adjacent room. Looking into that space, you see signs of another wall knocked over. It doesn\'t appear that anyone made an effort to clean up the rubble, but some paths through see more usage than others.', 'A chill wind blows against you as you open the door. Beyond it, you see that the floor and ceiling are nothing but iron grates. Above and below the grates the walls extend up and down with no true ceiling or floor within your range of vision. It\'s as though the chamber is a bridge through the shaft of a great well. Standing on the edge of this shaft, you feel a chill wind pass down it and over your shoulder into the hall beyond.', 'This room is shattered. A huge crevasse shears the chamber in half, and the ground and ceilings are tilted away from it. It\'s as though the room was gripped in two enormous hands and broken like a loaf of bread. Someone has torn a tall stone door from its hinges somewhere else in the dungeon and used it to bridge the 15-foot gap of the chasm between the two sides of the room. Whatever did that must have possessed tremendous strength because the door is huge, and the enormous hinges look bent and mangled.', 'A pit yawns open before you just on the other side of the door\'s threshold. The entire floor of the room has fallen into a second room beneath it. Across the way you can spy a door in the wall now 15 feet off the rubble-strewn floor, and near the center of the room stands a thick column of mortared stone that appears to hold the spiral staircase that leads down to what was the lower level.', 'As the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a floor covered in ice. The room before you looks like an ice cave. A tunnel wends its way through solid ice, and huge icicles and pillars of frozen water block your vision of its farthest reaches.', 'A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns merrily in a wide brazier the idol holds in its lap.', 'Several exits lead from this room, but only one is within the mouth of a man. The door opposite you stands within an intricate stone carving of a man\'s wide-open mouth. The man\'s nose and eyes loom over the door while his sculpted hair splays out across the wall on either side.', 'The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream. Three tables bend beneath a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping. Several bookshelves stand nearby stuffed to overfilling with a jumble of books, jars, bottles, bags, and boxes. The alchemist who set this all up doesn\'t seem to be present, but a beaker of green fluid boils over a burner on one of the tables.', 'The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and shattered wood grows white fungus.', 'Several white marble busts that rest on white pillars dominate this room. Most appear to be male or female humans of middle age, but one clearly bears small horns projecting from its forehead and another is spread across the floor in a thousand pieces, leaving one pillar empty.', 'A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks a head and stands in a posture of action or defense. All are garbed for battle. It\'s difficult to tell for sure without their heads, but two appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six appear human, and the rest look like they might be orcs.', 'A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly blocked by portcullises. Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the floor in the room against the walls. They seem in poses of repose rather than violence.', 'This tiny room holds a curious array of machinery. Winches and levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle from the ceiling. On a nearby wall, you note a pictogram of what looks like a scythe on a chain. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This room may be a control center for traps elsewhere in the dungeon.', 'This narrow room at first appears to be a dead-end corridor, but then you note several metal plates on the walls set at about eye height. Looking more closely, you see that one of these plates is slid aside to reveal a peephole.', 'You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and victors stripped them of their valuables.', 'The door in front of you seems to be stuck. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs yank it open, it comes open. Read the following: A furious rumble resounds in the area as stones come clattering through the doorway, along with a thick cloud of rock dust. The room beyond is filled with rubble.', 'This chamber served as an armory for some group of creatures. Armor and weapon racks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor. It hasn\'t been used in a long time, and all the useful weapons have been taken but for a single sword. Unlike the other weapons in the room, this one gleams untarnished in the light.', 'There\'s a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.', 'A horrendous, overwhelming stench wafts from the room before you. Small cages containing small animals and large insects line the walls. Some of the creatures look sickly and alive but most are clearly dead. Their rotting corpses and the unclean cages no doubt result in the zoo\'s foul odor. A cat mews weakly from its cage, but the other creatures just silently shrink back into their filthy prisons.', 'A cluster of low crates surrounds a barrel in the center of this chamber. Atop the barrel lies a stack of copper coins and two stacks of cards, one face up. Meanwhile, atop each crate rests a fan of five face-down playing cards. A thin layer of dust covers everything. Clearly someone meant to return to their game of cards.', 'This chamber of well-laid stones holds a wide bas-relief of a pastoral scene. In it you see a mountain like Mount Waterdeep, except that Castle Waterdeep and the city are missing. Instead, a small fishing village is a short way from a walled complex with several tall towers.', 'A stone throne stands on a foot-high circular dais in the center of this cold chamber. The throne and dais bear the simple adornments of patterns of crossed lines -- a pattern also employed around each door to the room.', 'A wall that holds a seat with a hole in it is in this chamber. It\'s a privy! The noisome stench from the hole leads you to believe that the privy sees regular use.', 'The burble of water reaches your ears after you open the door to this room. You see the source of the noise in the far wall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with the figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.', 'This room holds six dry circular basins large enough to hold a man and a dry fountain at its center. All possess chipped carvings of merfolk and other sea creatures. It looks like this room once served some group of people as a bath.', 'A glow escapes this room through its open doorways. The masonry between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance. Glancing quickly about the room, you note that each stone bears the carving of someone\'s name. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Consider putting the name of one of your party\'s characters on the wall.', 'A huge stewpot hangs from a thick iron tripod over a crackling fire in the center of this chamber. A hole in the ceiling allows some of the smoke from the fire to escape, but much of it expands across the ceiling and rolls down to fill the room in a dark fog. Other details are difficult to make out, but some creature must be nearby, because it smells like a good soup is cooking.', 'You\'ve opened the door to a torture chamber. Several devices of degradation, pain, and death stand about the room, all of them showing signs of regular use. The wood of the rack is worn smooth by struggling bodies, and the iron maiden appears to be occupied by a corpse.', 'This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone.', 'Corpses and pieces of corpses hang from hooks that dangle from chains attached to thick iron rings. Most appear humanoid but a few of the body parts appear more monstrous. You don\'t see any heads, hands, or feet -- all seem to have been chopped or torn off. Neither do you see any guts in the horrible array, but several thick leather sacks hang from hooks in the walls, and they are suspiciously wet and the leather looks extremely taut -- as if it\' under great strain.', 'This small chamber seems divided into three parts. The first has several hooks on the walls from which hang dusty robes. An open curtain separates that space from the next, which has a dry basin set in the floor. Beyond that lies another parted curtain behind which you can see several straw mats in a semicircle pointing toward a statue of a dog-headed man. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The first part of the room may have been used for changing and cleaning feet before entering the room with the statue.', 'When looking into this chamber, you\'re confronted by a thousand reflections of yourself looking back. Mirrored walls set at different angles fill the room. A path seems to wind through the mirrors, although you can\'t tell where it leads.', 'A large forge squats against the far wall of this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a wide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt for use in pounding out shapes in hot metal. Other forge tools hang in racks nearby, and a barrel of water and bellows rest on the floor nearby.', 'This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners\' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn\'t allow you to see the full extent of them all.', 'You push open the stone door to this room and note that the only other exit is a door made of wood. It and the table shoved against it are warped and swollen. Indeed, the table only barely deserves that description. Its surface is rippled into waves and one leg doesn\'t even touch the floor. The door shows signs of someone trying to chop through from the other side, but it looks like they gave up.', 'This otherwise bare room has one distinguishing feature. The stone around one of the other doors has been pulled over its edges, as though the rock were as soft as clay and could be moved with fingers. The stone of the door and wall seems hastily molded together.', 'You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you\'re uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber. The wall was an illusion and whoever cast it must be nearby!', 'You feel a sense of foreboding upon peering into this cavernous chamber. At its center lies a low heap of refuse, rubble, and bones atop which sit several huge broken eggshells. Judging by their shattered remains, the eggs were big enough to hold a crouching man, making you wonder how large -- and where -- the mother is.', 'This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of a minotaur lies on the floor, its belly carved out. The creature\'s innards are largely missing, and yet you detect no other wounds. Bloody, froglike footprints track away from the corpse and out an open door.', 'A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in stonework -- but given the themes represented, it might be better described as a requiem. Scenes of death, both violent and peaceful, appear on every wall framed by grinning skeletons and ghoulish forms in ragged cloaks.', 'A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the floor. Looking into the room is like looking down on a forest. Tall tangles of fungus resemble forested hills, the barren floor looks like a plain between the woods, and even a trickle of water and a puddle of water that pools in a low spot bears a resemblance to a river and lake, respectively.', 'You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points while flowstone makes strange shapes on the floor.', 'You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor with the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight.', 'This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. Two great feathered wings droop from its back, both sculpted to look broken. The statue is skillfully crafted.', 'The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges. Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble tiles. Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the room along with some small reading tables.', 'Many small desks with high-backed chairs stand in three long rows in this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted candle in a rusting tin candleholder. Everything is covered with dust. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The room could have been a scriptorium at some point.', 'You round the corner to see a ghastly scene. A semitranslucent figure hangs in the air, studded with crossbow bolts and with blood pouring from every wound. It reaches toward you in a pleading gesture, points to the walls on either side of the room, and then vanishes. Once it has gone, you notice small holes in the walls, each just large enough for a bolt to pass through.', 'You open the door and before you is a dragon\'s hoard of treasure. Coins cover every inch of the room, and jeweled objects of precious metal jut up from the money like glittering islands in a sea of gold. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Taking one step in the room alerts the PCs to the disappointing truth. Their feet pass silently through the illusion of the coins to strike the solid floor beneath.', 'You open the door to reveal a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains. No other doors are in the room, and it appears the door you opened was created to blend in with the walls. Additionally, you see no ceiling. You must be at the bottom of a very deep spiked pit.', 'You open the door to a long narrow room with a high ceiling. Three thick circles of wood rest on wooden stands. You\'re not certain what they are because you came into the room behind them. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs step in the room to get a better look, they see that each is painted with concentric circles marred by dozens of cuts into its surface. They\'re targets, and the PCs are on the wrong end of an archery range.', 'You open the door to what must be a combat training room. Rough fighting circles are scratched into the surface of the floor. Wooden fighting dummies stand waiting for someone to attack them. A few punching bags hang from the ceiling. There\'s something peculiar about it all though. Every dummy is stocky and each has a bedraggled piece of leather hanging from its head that could be a long mask or a beard.', 'This small room contains several pieces of well-polished wood furniture. Eight ornate, high-backed chairs surround a long oval table, and a side table stands next to the far exit. All bear delicate carvings of various shapes. One bears carvings of skulls and bones, another is carved with shields and magic circles, and a third is carved with shapes like flames and lightning strokes. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The eight chairs represent the eight schools of magic.', 'The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone\'s wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish.', 'Looking into this room, you note four pits in the floor. A wide square is nearest you, a triangular pit beyond it, and a little farther than both lie two circular pits. The room is rectangular nearest you but it widens into a larger rounded chamber starting just beyond the rectangular pit. You note that many flagstones, ceiling tiles, and wall blocks are carved with a skull emblem of some kind, whose dark openings emulate the layout of the pits. You\'ve opened a door in the \'chin\' and are looking up at the face.', 'This room looks like it was designed by drow. Rusted metal tiles create a huge mosaic of a spider in the floor, and someone set up rusted gratings like draperies of webs. At the far end of the chamber, the carving of a spider squats on the floor. It\'s about 3 feet tall and seems molded into the floor. Beyond it stands tall double doors of stone, their surface covered in a glittering web of gold.', 'You peer through the open doorway into a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved as tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest. Stone root systems crawl out into the floor and marble branches expand across the ceiling. You even note a few carvings of small birds and squirrels. Beautiful as they are, the sculpting doesn\'t appear elven, and it\'s nothing dwarves would carve.', 'This small room is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls. The seats all have holes in their top, like a privy. Facing stones on the front of the benches prevent you from seeing how deep the holes go. It looks like a communal bathroom. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> The PCs may have heard that these are common in Chessenta, but that country is hundreds of miles to the east and south.', 'In the center of this large room lies a 30-foot-wide round pit, its edges lined with rusting iron spikes. About 5 feet away from the pit\'s edge stand several stone semicircular benches. The scent of sweat and blood lingers, which makes the pit\'s resemblance to a fighting pit or gladiatorial arena even stronger.', 'This room is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze doors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide. The double doors are peaked at their centers, but unlike many sets of double doors, their division isn\'t in the center. Instead, the crack between the doors resembles a crooked bolt of lightning, which a figure in a cloud carved in the stone above the door appears to be hurling. The lightning bolt strikes down roughly 2 feet to the right of center. The figure in the clouds is deliberately indistinct, but it appears male, having a beard and male proportions. The stroke of bronze electricity hits a tower that seems small compared to the figure. This tower cracks down the center, continuing the gap between the doors until it reaches the ground. To either side of the tower lie pastoral scenes of hillsides dotted with sheep. There doesn\'t appear to be a lock or handles.', 'You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to the proportions of giants. Huge niches are set into the walls within which you can discern giant bones. Stern-looking statues of stone giants stand 20 feet tall against the walls, and in the center of the room lies a 15-foot-long sarcophagus.', 'This chamber holds an odd contraption of metal and wood. It\'s a 20-foot-diameter circular platform that is tilted heavily to one side. Beneath it you can discern mechanisms that seem to attach to a large crank not far away. Above the platform hang metal weights on thin chains, which in turn are attached to discs and belts that are attached to other winches. It seems as though turning the winches turns and tilts the platform and sets the weights to moving. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This could be a training room for combat, but the PCs don\'t see any weapons inside. Certainly it would take a great deal of concentration to fight on the platform; perhaps it\'s a training room for monks or spellcasters.', 'You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall. Above it stands a strange statue of a lobster-headed and clawed woman. The statue is nearly 15 feet tall and holds the lobster claws crossed over its naked breasts.', 'Stinking smoke wafts up from braziers made of skulls set around the edges of this room. The walls bear scratch marks and lines of soot that form crude pictures and what looks like words in some language [Goblin]. To the left lies a pile of rubbish and rubble heaped into a crude dais.

When the party enters it activates, and completely breaks down without harming anyone. The mechanism looks to have been chewed on by rats.', 'The floor of this room is made of countless bamboo rings. There are empty paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. On the walls are samurai swords. Inspecting the swords reveals them to be very high class replicas, useless for combat.', 'There are several not so neat rows of school desks and chairs in this room.

If someone picks up the hat the sound of flute music is heard from somewhere beyond the room.', 'There are three grand pianos in this room. On the walls are blue velvet curtains.

One sounds almost dainty, one plays somber sad sounds, and the third can only do grim dark, regardless of the song played.', 'In this room there is the aftermath of a recently fought battle. When the party enters the room they will suddenly realize that the entrance they used was actually a wall someone hacked through with a battlexe. The other entrance(s) had been barricaded with various furniture. The barricade on the opposite side has been cast aside as if someone immensely strong charged into it. The room used to look like a barracks, but everything in it is in shambles. The markings suggest numerous people fought here, but only two are still in the room. A highborn lady is slumped against a writing desk, her skull cracked. Near her on the floor is a dying man dressed like a wizard. If someone from the party approaches him he will whisper \'Tell them, my name was, Ekhnaton..\' and then he will die. There is an odd resonating vibration in the air near both of the bodies.

The room itself is boringly grey. There\'s a large loom here, and several spools of different kinds of thread. In the corner is a basket with a couple of warm shirts.', 'Opening the doors to this room is difficult. It\'s as if they are fighting back. When the party enters all of the doors slam shut.

None have any blood on their points.', 'A rocky outcrop on one wall looks a little like a melted giant’s face emerging from the rock, in the party’s flickering lights.', 'Water drips from a crack in the ceiling creating a curtain blocking further progress.

Un des guerriers (déterminé aléatoirement) est soudain assailli de tous les côtés par les esprits des seigneurs de ce royaume, morts depuis ', 'PORTE SECRETE;\n\n Les yeux perçants d\'un guerrier remarquent que les pierres du mur dissimulent habilement une porte secrète.', 'Dud Door I\n\nThe players find a hidden door. It\'s painted bright pink and has hundreds of coloured lights and levers. Nothing can force it open, and clairvoyance, teleport etc don\'t work beyond it. If anyone pulls a lever, everyone within 10\' gets a 1d8 electric shock and all the lights change color.\n\nAfterthought: The characters are being chased by a powerful monster and they wind up in a dead end with this door as the only way out. See how desperate they get to figure it out with the monster 15 seconds behind them.\n\n', 'Dud Door II\n\nSomewhere in the dungeon the players find a locked door they can\'t force, pick, or whatever. Later the come across a large crystal key. If the key is placed in the lock, it is ripped from the character\'s grasp and swallowed by the door.\n\nAfterthought: The key then reappears wherever it was before.\n\n', 'Invisible Bridge\n\nAn invisible bridge 1\' wide and 50\' long spans a deep chasm. The players have to:\n\n1) work out that it\'s there.\n\n2) convince themselves that it\'s there.\n\n3) work out a system of ropes etc to make sure no one falls. \n\nUse dex checks to determine chances of falling. Strong winds, hostile flying creatures, and a fear of heights could make this harder.\n\nAfterthought: There is a 3\' long gap in the centre of the bridge, and if the players assume that it\'s solid all the way and walk over... The gap can be jumped easily once they know it\'s there.\n\n', 'Appearing Bridge\n\nScenario similar to \'Invisible Bridge\', except that the bridge isn\'t even there until someone tries to step on it. Then it appears, one foot at a time, and everyone can see it.\n\nAfterthought: The characters are being chased, and anyone running along the bridge will move faster than the blocks can appear, and fall. The blocks may disappear again behind the characters to stop the monster pursuing.\n\n', 'Guard Route\n\nGuards patrol an area the characters must gain entry to. The guards are too nasty to fight and the party cannot risk raising the alarm.\n\nSolution: Sleep or charm spells\n\nImpersonate guard\n\nImpersonate high official and bluff\n\nKill a guard and take uniform\n\nInvisibility or fly\n\nDistraction\n\netc.\n\n', 'Object on High Hook\n\nA valuable object (keys?) sits on a small hook 80\' up an unclimbable wall. An anti-magic field surrounds the room.\n\nSolution: fire an arrow or throw something to knock the object off the hook.\n\nAfterthought: Object is fragile and someone must be standing ready to catch it.\n\n', 'Sleeping Guards\n\nThe characters gain entry to a guardroom full of sleeping guards. They must kill the guards or sneak past them to gain an object.\n\nAfterthought: If any of the players speaks to another player (simulating character-character conversation) during this encounter, the guards wake.\n\n', 'Pit with Trap Door\n\nThe first character falls into a pit trap for low damage. It\'s easy to get out again, but if they stop to search, they find a trapdoor to another area in the bottom of the pit.\n\n', 'Archer Attack at Point-Blank\n\nThe party engages in combat with a few archers, who eventually scatter and run for it. The characters don\'t pursue, and later open a door to find one of the archers 2\' behind it pointing a crossbow at his head for LOTS of damage.\n\nAfterthought: The archers are in fact scattered in ambush positions right through the dungeon. Hear noise will detect them on the other side of doors.\n\n', 'Flammable Slime\n\nGooey green slime drips onto a character\'s head. It does no damage (the player doesn\'t know that), but tell the player that it\'s itching and stinging. The slime can be scraped off easily with a weapon. However, it is highly flammable and attempts to burn it off are likely to end in disaster.\n\nAfterthought: The players can collect the slime and make molotov cocktails (if acceptable recepticals can be found).\n\n', 'Wounded Monster Seen Escaping\n\nThe party turns a corner to see a wounded monster slinking off. If the players follow, they lead into an ambush.\n\n', 'Glory Device\n\nThe players find a statue of a fighter desperately trying to press the button in the centre of an amulet he\'s wearing. The amulet is not petrified and can be taken from the fighter (whose ghost later haunts them?). Pressing the button obliterates everything within 15\' - the fighter knew he was going to die and was trying to take the monster with him.\n\nAfterthought: To be fair, you should give the players some kind of warning about the amulet rather than just killing them all off for experimenting. Perhaps a loud siren sounds the first time they press the button, and it explodes on the second?\n\n', 'Statues Abound ... Medusa?\n\nThe players find serval statues scattered around a room. The door is closed, and they should get the hint from the statues that the have to open it with eyes shut and mirrors ready. If not, well, it\'s their own fault.\n\n', 'Stone Block & Trap Door\n\nA 5\' x 5\' x 5\' stone block in the corner of a room with an 11\' ceiling. Stand on block, poke ceiling and find a trapdoor to another area. (This is a really old trick, so expect the players to find it).\n\nAfterthought: The block rises up after the characters, blocking the trapdoor and trapping them.\n\n', 'Drink Me!\n\nThe characters enter a room containing a potion labelled \'drink me\'. Searching the room will reveal a mousehole about 4\' high.\n\nSolution: drink potion.But how is the character going to get back to full size ? \n\n ', 'Riddling Statue\n\nA room containing a statue of a sage and no doors (the door the party entered by has disappeared). Teleport etc won\'t get them out of the room. The statue will answer any question with \'what\' in it (such as \'What is the easiest way toget out of here ?\'), even if the party did not intend it as a question. One in four answers are false, and the statue will answer a maximum of six questions.\n\nThe easiest way out is to ask the statue. If the characters waste their questions, they\'ll have to find another way.\n\n', 'Bottomless Hole\n\nFor some reason (a bet? a spell?), the party has to find out whether a hole is bottomless or not. Easy. Drop something down and listen.\n\nAfterthought: If they watch it carefully, the party will find that the hole is slowly but steadily moving towards them. Anyone who falls in will probably never be recovered. The hole will chase them throughout the entire dungeon, which raises an interesting question: how do you kill a hole? You fill it in.\n\n', 'Spkiy Mat with Object\n\nA 3\' x 3\' mat covered in long poisonous spikes. Stuck to the underside is a valuable object.\n\nAfterthought: The mat wakes up and starts chasing the characters.\n\nSolution: Flip the mat over with a polearm.\n\n', 'Timebomb\n\nA room containing a 3\' black sphere (a bomb), and a complicated timing device. It will explode and destroy some valuable treasure if the characters run. If they try to disarm it, either make an INT check or use this puzzle:\n\nAfterthought: The players take the bomb with them (by rolling it along the ground), and later reactivate it to destroy something.\n\n', 'Equipment Must be Destroyed\n\nFor some reason (about to summon a monster?), equipment in a room must be destroyed quickly and completely.\n\n', 'Capture Enemy Mage\n\nThe party enters a mage\'s sleeping quarters to find him asleep on a bunk. They can capture him and interrogate, but must beware of verbal-only spells and sudden escape attempts.\n\n', 'Glass Ceiling\n\nStuck for a way to get out of the dungeon, the party enters a room with a glass dome 50\' up for a ceiling. Through the glass they can see the sky.\n\nSolution: Smash glass and climb or fly up.\n\nAfterthought: Shards of falling glass do some damage if they didn\'t get out of the way in time.\n\n', 'Dead Rat\n\nInside a treasure chest the characters find: a dead rat. Inside the rat is a 1000GP gem - and if they don\'t cut it open they\'ll never know.\n\n', 'Killer Veggies\n\nA good trap to use if the group isn\'t cooperating. The first character in line opens a door to be grabbed by some strange vegetation. The victim will be digested in 30 seconds, and the only way to free them is for EVERY member of the group to assist in pulling them out.\n\n', 'Scratches in Walls Near Lair\n\nObservant characters will spot long scratches on the walls. They should thus be prepared for a surprise attack by a wererat, or equivalent. If nobody commented on the scratches or what they could signify, the monsters automatically get surprise.\n\n', 'Invisible Force Field\n\nA valuable item sits in the centre of the floor. If anyone tries to get near, they\'ll feel bars pushing against their chest and legs. Note that tall characters will NOT feel bars against their head, but you don\'t have to tell them this unless they ask. The bars are only 5\' high, but it will take some experimenting to figure this out. Once they know, magic or a good jump should get them over.\n\nAfterthought: It could also be set up so that the bars are 8\' tall, but only surround three sides of the item.\n\n', 'Greed Trap I\n\nA 20\'x10\' room with a door at each end. The floor is covered with gold pieces. The party can take as many as they can carry.\n\nThe problem is, the gold is what\'s holding the floor down. The moment more than 150gp leaves the room (like when the first character leaves, and the others are still there), the floor will shoot up and slam them against the ceiling (or drop out from under them).\n\n', 'Greed Trap II\n\nA gently sloping corridor 5\' wide and 100\' long. Darkened. Every 10 feet there is a valuable item of some sort. The slope gradually steepens and becomes slippery. After 60\', the characters cannot get back up, and will slide into a deep pit at the end of the corridor.\n\nAfterthought: Roping the characters together will fix this problem. They could also try descending into the pit and finding the treasure left behind when previous people fell for this.\n\n', 'Doppleganger\n\nOne of the adventurers (better make it an NPC, to be fair) is silently killed and their place taken by a doppleganger. The doppleganger has all the powers of the person it killed and will betray the group at a suitable moment.\n\n', 'Humungus Fungus\n\nA 6\'x6\'x6\' soft green lump in the centre of the room. Can climb over it - carefully - with no trouble. If it\'s punctured, spores do LOTS of damage.\n\nAfterthought: Several other, smaller, green lumps are seen throughout the dungeon. They gradually grow and multiply.\n\n', 'Trapped Demon\n\nA demon trapped in a magic pentagram tries to persuade the characters to release it (promises gold, etc.). Upon release, the demon attempts to kill the party.\n\nAfterthought: If the character has knowledge of the creatures origin (perhaps a religion non-weapon proficiency), they may be able to guess the demon\'s intentions.\n\n', 'Tall Room and a Bucket\n\nThe characters are in a very tall, but thin room. There is a trap door on the ceiling and a bucket of water sits in the corner. The walls cannot be climbed and spells are ineffective in the room. If the characters empty the bucket (spill, knock over, etc.), they notice that it magically refills.\n\nSolution: Keep emptying the bucket, fill the room and swim up.\n\n', 'Controlled Player\n\nOne of the characters picks up a sword (or whatever), and is immediately controlled. The rest of the party must use unarmed combat to remove the weapon, without killing the controlled character.\n\n', 'Rescue Prisoners\n\nThe party enters a jail of some sort. After killing the jailor, they rescue the prisoners. Some may be reliable, some could try to betray the characters.\n\nAfterthought: One of them is a lycanthrope. Or a vampire. Or a polymorphed evil mage.\n\n', 'Good or Evil\n\nThe spies a band of orcs guarding three wounded people, but something doesn\'t feel right about the situation. A perceptive player will notice that all of the orcs are carrying ornate broadsword (uncommon for orcs), and the wounded humans are licking their wounds and snarling. The magic in the room is actually playing tricks on the players, and creating an illusion - The orcs are actually soldiers guarding three wounded orcs.\n\n', 'Pictured Door\n\nAn enormous room is lined with large, heavy tapestries. One of the dozens of tapestries show a corridor, similar to the entrance. Surprise, the tapastries is actually a magical door.\n\n', 'Dud Money\n\nA large bird is seen lying in the corner of a cave. Not far from the bird is a chest full of coins. Surprise, the coins are actually tiny eggs, with an illusion cast upon them. Attempting to pick up the \'coins\' will shatter an egg and alert the large bird to the parties presense.\n\n', 'Catch 22 Pit Trap\n\nA player character falls in a pit, taking standard falling damage and separating him from his comrades. In the pit are two levers. The first lever throws the player out of the traps with 3d6 dmg from the force of landing or hitting the ceiling. The other lever will let off a full fireball above the trapped player, getting his comrades.\n\n', 'Teleporting Pit Trap\n\nWhen the player falls in he is teleported to a random location. If his companions follow, they might go to a different location.\n\nAfterthought: Good for separating parties. The same trap can be used in a doorway - A player walks through a doorway, unaware of the portal, and is teleported elsewhere. His comrades may attempt walking through (thinking they will end up in the same place as their friend), and end up in a different place.\n\n', 'Egg Beater Trap\n\nUpon falling into the pit, the player notices three stone fists coming out of the walls. The fists attempt tograb the player once he\'s down, attempting to strip him of everything he is wearing, and give him several punches. The stone fists have a strength of 19 and 20 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and lightening. There are usually a lot of bones and treasure in the pit for those who are strong enough to take it.\n\n', 'Delayed Trap\n\nThe trap isn\'t tripped until the third character passes, or waits one round before going off. For example, the last player enters a corridor - BANG! - the door shuts behind them - RUMBLE! RUMBLE! - suddenly a huge boulder starts rolling down the corridor behind them - RUN!!!\n\n', 'Teleport Loop\n\nThe character enters a teleporter that teleports him to another teleport that teleports him back. The loop continues until a condition is met (usually a dispel magic is cast or a lever somewhere down the corridor is pulled). This will frazzle most players.\n\n', 'Yellow Mold Death\n\nPicture a room with Yellow Mold covering the floor. The room is 50x50 and 30 feet high. On the ceiling are stalagtites. In reality they are piercers (see Monstrous Compendium). In the back of the room is a chest that is bolted to the floor, it is not covered by the mold. If the characters walk on the floor then the mold will go off. So most of the time they will choose to fly, or use ropes on the stalagtites. That is when the fun starts. When they get half way across the room the piercers start dropping. If they hit the fool who is flying then so be it. They will probably fall into the mold causing it to go off. But if the piercers miss, then they hit the mold. Very bad for the characters indeed.\n\n', 'Handy Door\n\nUpon opening a door, have a large glowing fist slam into the lead character (2d10 damage - saving throw vs. death for half damage). Of course, even if he makes the roll, he\'s going to go flying through the air and hit the wall (1d6 Dex check for no damage). But, in order for your characters to truly appreciate this trap, you must explain that the hand then grabs the door knob and pulls the door shut behind it. Assuming the players have any brains, they should realize the trap just reset itself.\n\nSolution: You can allow a dispel spell, but that would take the fun out of it. Have the players knock. If you want to make it more difficult, have the players say a password.\n\n', 'The Pedestal\n\nThe players stand in a large and featureless room, at the center of which is a pedestal holding a valueable item. There is a chimney-like hole in the ceiling above, but the player\'s can\'t see where it leads. When the item is touched, the cieling surround the pedestal begins to drop. \n\nIf the players react quick enough, they will move to the pedestal (since the chimney will provide safety from the crushing cieling). Now, trapped in the pedestal, area, the players notice there is no breeze. The pedestal area is air tight! \n\nThe players have only have about an hour max worth of air. Unless one of the characters is a mage, or has a magical device (teleport, transmute rock or mud) they are in big trouble.\n\nSolution: As mentioned, spells can be effective here. But, the valuable item that was found on the pedestal can also be used. Perhaps it is a rare device that the players must figure out - once the devices secrets are found, the trap resets and they can procede onward. Or maybe the valuable item can simply teleport them to another room.\n\nPerhaps the pedestal has a reset switch on it, but it should be difficult to find because all of the players are trapped in the small room.\n\n', 'Mimic\n\nA mimic (se Monstrous Compendium) is a creature that disguises itself as an inanimate object to lures it\'s prey. It tends to disguise itself as treasure chests and banquet tables. Greater Mimics (see Monstrous Compendium Annual 2) have been said to disguise themselves as entire rooms (imagine seeing a doorway leading into a room full of treasure ... which is actually the creatures mouth, leading into it\'s stomach).\n\n', 'Golems\n\nMany great magicians use golems and mechanical warriors to protect their lairs & treasures. Below are a list of man-made guards (and where they can be found):\n\nAutomaton, Scaladar (Monst. Comp. Annual 2)\n\nAutomaton, Triobrands (Monst. Comp. Annual 2)\n\nBurning Man Golem (Monst. Comp. Annual 2)\n\nClay Golem (Monstrous Comp. Vol. 1)\n\nCopper Automaton (Al-Qadim)\n\nFlesh Golem (Monstrous Comp. Vol. 1)\n\nHalf-Golem (Ravenloft)\n\nIron Golem (Monstrous Comp. Vol. 1)\n\nLightning Golem (Forgot. Realms)\n\nMagma Golem (Darksun)\n\nMechanical Golem (Ravenloft)\n\nPhantom Flyer Golem (Monst. Comp. Annual 2)\n\nSalt Golem (Darksun)\n\nStone Golem (Monstrous Comp. Vol. 1)\n\n', 'Summon Dragon\n\nThe players open the door to the room to see a huge skeleton crammed into a 10\'x10\' room, in the middle of the room is the shattered but complete skeleton of a man holding a device in his hand. If anyone has the necessary knowledge, the huge skeleton can be identified as a dragon.\n\nAfterthought: It would be down to the GM as to the specifics of the device, how many charges are on it, whether it still works, how it is triggered etc. The device itself summons the dragon immediately and permanently (or else the man would have left the room before it arrived, and the dragon would no longer be in the room if not permanent) so I would suggest the the device not confer any control over the dragon to the user, which in itself could be a second nasty surprise for them.\n\nYou could add the bodies of several attackers which had prompted the human to use his new found device in self defense, perhaps not knowing what it actually did.\n\nSolution: The device in the humans hand is actually a device which summons a dragon. The human made a mistake in using it in a confined space and was crushed by the dragon, which itself died, unable to move in such a small space. This isn\'t really a trap as such, more a puzzle, a wary character would walk through this situation without any troubles.\n\n', 'Look Up\n\nThe players come across a bottle with a message in it. The message says look up. Players who fail to think of the consequences for their actions will be harmed in some way - when they look up, various bad things can happen. An archer suspended from the cieling fires off a called shot head; or a trap with a three second delay goes off, hitting the player in the face (rock, goo, mother-in-law, ect.); a beast is dropped from above.\n\nAfterthought: Could very well kill most wounded or low level characters. Mainly the curious ones. Also a good strategy for setting amushes.\n\n', 'Fighters\' Nightmare\n\nBehind a heavy, locked, and possibly trapped door is giant stone pit (100\' x 100\'). There is a series of holes cut into the wall directly underneat the door which forms a crude ladder. In the center of the room sits a pedestal with a huge gem atop it (or maybe it\'s a book on a wooden pedestal, or an ancient skeleton wrapped in a cloak sitting on an ivory throne--anything non-metal that whets the party\'s interest). Of course the fun begins when a character tries to move the gem (or whatever). At that point secret doors on the four walls open and four (or more) ravenously hungry rust monsters come running out. They are unable to climb out of the pit, but they should be able to ruin the day of any fighter in the pit when the doors open.\n\nAfterthought: The treasure in the center of the room is trapped, casting a powerful paralyze spell as soon as it is touched. The treasure might also be worthless.\n\nSolution: Use telekenesis to move the treasure. Of course spells may not work in the room. In that case, only one party member needs to enter the pit, then only his armor and weapons get destroyed. Of course a party who sends its members off on its own (even when all members are still in sight of each other) is more likely to be split up.\n\n', 'The Gargoyle Trap\n\nThe character\'s enter a room, with gargoyle statues lined along the walls. One of the characters steps on a trigger device, activating the trap. The doors suddenly shut and the gargoyle statues open their mouths, spitting streams of water into the room. The room begins to flood.\n\nAfterthought: Attempting to destroy the statues only results to a pile of rubble, and a spout that continues to fill the room. Attempting to plug this spout is futile, becuase the pressure is too strong (and there are several other spouts filling the room as well).\n\nSolution: A simple search, DC 20 will reveal a trap door, upon opening this trap door, all the water goes in it and the room is dry again, but how the hell do we get out of the room???\n\n', 'Snake Room\n\nThe players enter a room with a pedestal in the center, and lots of circular holes in the walls and roof, in the pedestal lies a gem, more specificaly a giant diamond worth 5,000 gp. the pedestal is in the center of a pentagram in the floor. When the characters grab the gem nothing happens, but when they remove it from the pentagram, the doors shut, and from the holes fall hundreds of snakes.\n\nAfterthought: Snakes are weak, and there is an antitoxin in the next room, but they can\'t continue until they have killed all of the snakes.\n\nPoison: Fort Save DC 22\n\nInitial Damage: 1D6 Constitution (temporary)\n\nSecondary Damage: 2D6 Constitution (temporary)\n\n', 'Perspective\'s End\n\nA long hallway of about twenty feet which ends with a doorway. The doorway is actually an illusion and merely a wall. The hallway may start at about 10\' x 10\', but it grows smaller. The look of it gives the illusion of perspective when moving down the hallway, but instead of looking as if it gets smaller (as all hallways do), it truly does get smaller. At the end, the hallway is 3\' x 3\'.\n\nAfterthought: This might lead heroes to an untimely end if being pursued, the hallway cramming them into a small space for an easy mark.\n\n', 'Clone Wars\n\nYou and your party walk into a room filled with mirrors. Suddenly, you hear an evil laugh as the images upon the mirrors come to life! Now there are clones for every character. This fight will not be easy, since you can not tell the differnce between the real character and the clone.\n\nAfterthought: The clones have the same looks and powers of their look-a-like, and even some of the same habit raits. Characters may have more than one clone. That is, if your really up for a challenge. (clones have a rank total of 20 bluff)\n\nSolution: You may make a charisma/bluff check to see if it\'s your friend or foe.\n\n', 'Wall Of Illusion\n\nWhen you and your party walks through a certain doorway, you are immediatly teleported to the entrance of the dungeon.\n\nAfterthought: If you go back to that doorway a second time, the door will not be there. In it\'s place will be a solid wall. If a player walks through the wall (it\'s just an illusion anyway) they will NOT be transported to the dungeon entrance ... instead, they will enter a room containing some treasure.\n\nSolution: Travel back through the dungeon.\n\n', 'n\n\nLying in the middle of the dark hall lies a corpse. Next to the corpse are two empty pouches and a journal rests in its arms. The journal is written in an ancient elven language. The journal reads, I write quickly, for he is coming.The ghost will not take me withour a fight.However, I fear I am lost.I have found it \'s only weakness, but lack the compo... it\' s cut off with dark red blood stains.\n\nSolution: Make a check to see if you can read the text beneath the blood stains(Read DC 15 - Elf Lang).Success makes out the word components. The party may decipher that a spell needs to be cast(components is the first hint.The empty pouches are a second hint).An intelligence check at this point may lead to the following.  The person had found this ghosts weakness - magic. Unfortunately for this individual, he had no spell components left and died in his fight.\n\n', 'Key Rings\n\nIn a tray are about 100 rings, all cheap looking. There is no door in this room after you enter, only a like large keyhole on the far wall. (Thieves who might want to try and pick the lock need make a DC 60 or be put to sleep for 24 hours - unwakable sleep). Also in the room is a foot long tapered stick. Hmmm, what to do ... A more thorough (sp?) search of the ring tray reveals that 7 of the rings aren\'t just gold or silver bands, but have different jewels on them.\n\nAfterthought: This is a good puzzle to start off a puzzled themed adventure, it gets players into a mindset that will help them solve puzzles.\n\nSolution: The rings are of different sizes, and will fit on the stick in a specific order. Then you can take your key ring (or your stick of rings) and open the lock, which reveals an exit.\n\n', 'Treasure Chest of Doom\n\nAn elaborate chest sits in the center of a room. Standing directly in front of the chest triggers the pressure plate at its base, springing the would be thief against the far wall, which is actually an illusionary wall. The thief travels about ten feet further, smacking into a real wall and dropping into a 50ft chasm with some spikes at the bottom. Hitting the wall triggered oil to fall atop the thief and a few seconds later a flame arrow fires down the chasm into the spikes and the oil covered thief.\n\nAfterthought: You can add poison to the spikes if you want to further damage the thief.\n\nSolution: Reflex saves abound, this trap is designed for a high level rogue who needs to be humbled.\n\n', 'The Shifting Transparent Labyrinth\n\nYour adventures are trailing behind their mark as he disappears in a cave. Upon entering the cave they see a long corridor with eventually engulfs all light.\n\nAs they venture deeper and deeper. They emerge form the long tunnel into the edge of a huge room. In the center of room they see a shining object on a pedestal.\n\nIf they venture forward they smash into an invisible wall of some kind stops them. (Stone wall augmentation - Transparency). They can only go left or right. They will choose either direction. This is when the fun begins. As they progress through the labyrinth they will be constantly banging in the walls (no damage - except for a sore nose, until they learn to walk with their hands in font of them.) As they are walking parts of the wall are constantly shifting positions. If you want to instigate a bit of panic, at some point one of the wall shifts could cut party members off form on another. The rest is up to you.\n\nAfterthought: What about their mark you ask? If the party had turned around and looked up, when they first got into the edge of the cave, they might have seen a small dark hole in the ceiling. This leads to the marks hiding spot. This can be as simple or as complex as you want, but a main room with 2-3 other smaller rooms should do the trick. Remember that behind on of the doors will be their mark and who knows what else!\n\nSolution: Smear something on the walls or scorch with fire. The goo or the charcoal will stick and be visible\n\n', 'Legless Door\n\nThe door out of this coridoor has no lock, door knob etc. Although, at the top and bottom it has metal pannels. This door is clearly meant to be broken through. When the door is kicked through, the top metal pannel reveals its true form which is a guilotine - it falls down and severs the characters leg. If the player charges through the door, ramming it with his shoulder, then more dire consequences can result.\n\nAfterthought: There may be body parts strewn around the door, and blood stains ... anything suggesting the danger. (perhaps, when the door is broken through, it magically repairs itself, so the door resets the trap)\n\nSolution: As breaking through the door can cause serious injure, and permanent damage, an alternative solution may be found. Use a spell to break through. Find another way around. Con an npc to attempt to break down the door (possible evil action). A regeneraltion spell may heal chopped-off limbs.\n\n', 'Jewel Dust\n\nAs the players approach a door (untrapped and unimportant), the players hear something shatter on the other side. When the door is opened, the players see the floor of this new chamber covered in a multi-colored sand-like substance. Intelligent characters may realise that the sand is actually crushed jewels - worthless, unless the players can find some eccentric mage or jeweller interested in them. In addition to this, one side of the room is pockmarked with about a hundred small holes, about the size of a ring.\n\nBy the time players have taken all this in - and they probably still haven\'t moved into the room - sparkling objects have begun to shoot from the holes and crash into the opposite wall, creating more puffs of the sand. Unknown to the players, but most likely assumed, the \'sparkling objects\' are of course gems ... but gems that are cut to be very sharp and happen to be flying from the wall at a considerable speed! Any attempts to catch or stop the gems before they are destroyed will result in nasty gouges, and even well armoured characters may suffer wounds as there is no way of discovering from which holes the gems will come from. After a wound has been taken, a gem can be recovered though (each worth about 1000 - 2000 gp) and if players specify that they are \'avoiding the missiles/gems\' the room can be crossed safely (with a successful dexterity check).\n\nAfterthought: Maybe the jewel dust, rather than being worthless, could help players blind or poison a creature later on.\n\nSolution: This doesn\'t need to be solved; greed may lead to injuries but careful characters can pass safely.\n\n', 'Issues Creature\n\nThe players open a door and see a large monster. This creature is limited only by the DM\'s imagination; it could be a dragon, a giant minotaur, a golem - it doesn\'t really matter. The creature will act offensively, yelling or roaring (think things like \'You\'re gonna die!\' or even just \'Die!\') and may raise weapons or rear back in anticipation of a strike. But all is not as it seems. The creature is fully real and alive, but the nature of this room is very strange. As soon as you enter the chamber, you can thrash and kick and swipe all you like, but within the dimensions of this room combat is prevented. You simply cannot make contact with any other any creature! This can have thousands of uses, and is particularly useful for cowardly characters who flee from encounters.\n\nAfterthought: Maybe archers shooting from outside the room could still damage those within.\n\nSolution: A powerful dispel magic might be able to remove the charm, but unless someone in the room has a great treasure there\'s really no need. Of course, the big introduction with the creature is unneccessary if you can come up with something better.\n\n', 'Giant Hoax\n\nThe party finds a giant bear trap (or other enlarged trapping device). As bait there is some treasure - if the party is on the run, make sure that the treasure is something they want. Well, rogues will inspect the trap. Tell them that they don\'t find anything that suggests the trap would work. Mages will then cast spells to see if magic is involved. Tell them they\'ve found nothing. By this time any pursuing monsters will have caught up, and the party will have to make a quick decision; do they risk a nasty fate or sacrifice the riches?\n\nAfterthought: This trick will definitely have to be used on the run, otherwise the party might waste too much time trying to figure it out.\n\nSolution: Well, the bear trap is fully UNoperation, and there\'s no enchantments involved. It\'s just a model of a bear trap! This trick will reward gutsy characters.\n\n', 'Antigrav Tunnel\n\nThe party is climbing up a chute, preferably in an area that has been high in magical references. There\'s no sign of danger, you tell the party that they can relax... then suddenly whoever is leading the climb is yanked from the wall and somehow manages to be falling upward!\n\nThe next few characters in line are meant to be a bit scared. If their personalities are particularly cautious chances, then they may not proceed at all. But apart from a possibly painful landing, the falling leader simply tumbles down from the roof of a new room entirely. When you think about it, that must mean that this new set of rooms is built upside down, but the freak of magic that is reversing gravity still means that the new rooms can be explored normally. In any case, chances are that the party may spend a while working it out.\n\nAfterthought: This fortress is definitely owned by a powerful wizard. There\'s no way anyone else could have created something so confusing!\n\nSolution: If there is something powerful and evil hiding in the second set of rooms a powerful dispel magic could bring their perfect world crashing down! Danger for the mage below, however, would still be high.\n\n', 'Prickly Lock\n\nThis is a simple trick to fool a low level rogue, or perhaps a non-rogue who is just trying his hand at lockpicking.\n\nTell the party that they are approaching a door with what appears to be a complicated lock, then specify to the rogue that though the lock is fancy, he thinks it will be simple to pick. Unbeknown to the poor rogue, the lock has two catches, each with its own DC ... and the lock is in fact incredible complicated!\n\nThe two DC\'s are 15 and 25-30. If the rogue passes the first one he has managed to turn the first catch - the false catch. So the rogue has his hands close up to the lock, and he turns his pick, and from small holes all around the key hole poisonous needles stab out, one or two at a time in an unpredicable fashion. The poison is of your choice, but as the rogue is meant to be low level don\'t make it anything too potent.\n\nAfterthought: This was based on a small line from the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. Perhaps if the rogue is very, very inexperienced you could make the needles longer rather than poisonous. This way a few stabs will make his fingers sore enough to prevent him from lock picking, but otherwise he\'ll be fine.\n\nSolution: As each needle stabs out, they can be broken off with a crushing weapon. Only when all the needles are broken can the rogue or another character make a second attempt on the second DC.\n\n', 'Ring of the Stab\n\nPlayers find a very thick and chunky ring - it\'s about half an inch thick and fits very akwardly on the finger. A fat ruby sits in the centre of it, and the ring is accompanied by a simple, roughly scrawled note:\n\n\'While wearing ring, think of injury location, press ruby HARD!\'\n\nPlayers will most likely keep the ring until one of them is hurt, and then the ruby will be pushed. The ruby is actually attached to a very thick and pointy spike, which when pushed will break through the weak inside of the ring and stab into the poor injured person who is wearing it. Then the poison that was sitting inside the metal band can pour into a freshly opened wound and enter the bloodstream.\n\nAfterthought: This is a very nasty little trick, and though it may seem a little \'unreal\' it is actually very possible. It\'s just a hollow band, filled with poison, with a weak underside and a spiked ruby. (I never said it would be common, just very possible!) This ring can even easily fool high level characters, especially if the note also specifies that it might only have one charge left. A minor charm of no significance might also have been cast on the gem, so that if a detect magic is cast the ring will appear to be enchanted.\n\nSolution: Don\'t push the ruby.\n\n', 'Trusting Stab\n\nPlayers find an elaborately carved altar, with a very intricate fleur-de-lis swirls and elvish symbols (as opposed to a darker design of thorns and skulls). Engraved somewhere nearby are the words:\n\n\'If thy wishes to make a wish,\n\nA sacrifise I demand.\n\nTake the dagger, slit thy throat,\n\nEnter the sacred land.\'\n\nA beautiful shell dagger lies on the altar ... a dagger stained with blood. Despite the calm and welcoming design, there are also a few blood stains on the floor around the altar.\n\nIt\'s a simple setup - a few words and some pretty carvings, with no wish spell or sacred land. So will a member of the party be stupid enough to kill themselves? Statistics show results may vary.\n\nAfterthought: If you want to make the trap nastier then perhaps whoever created it cleans it up after each use. Cancel the bloodstains, make the altar even more inviting by saying it has crystals inset in it\'s top, have a spell of no consequence over the area to throw off detect magics... it all comes down to how trusting the party is.\n\nSolution: Just pass on by. A detect magic will show there\'s nothing going on and the adventure can continue.\n\n', 'The Never-Ending Corridor\n\nPlayers enter through a non-descript wooden door that has no magical qualities about it. Once the players have past through the doorway and have begun to walk down the corridor they will find that they are getting no closer to the end (even though the door always appears to be 100 meters away) and if they look over their shoulders they will find that they are not getting any further from the entry door, no matter how fast or for how long they run. If they turn around and walk towards the entry door, they will find that they can still not get any closer.\n\nAfterthought: It would be interesting to see the players enter the corridor while being chased by a monster. They monster would not be able to attack them but to escape they must walk backwards TOWARD the moster. Fighting a monster over your shoulder would be very hard indeed.\n\nSolution: Simply walk backwards. Players may look over their shoulders but if at any point they turn and walk directly towards the door, they will again be stuck fast.\n\n', 'Here but for the Grace of God\n\nIn a plain, low-lit room, players find a large obsidian mirror (obsidian being a highly reflective Volcanic rock). The mirror, however, does not reflect the players images as a normal mirror dose. If touched, the magic mirror will transport players to a different plane of existance, an Opposite World.\n\nThe rest is up to the DM\'s imagination. The players could find themselves as a different sex, race, alignment or class. (A neutral evil, male dwarf Warrior suddenly becomes a lawful good, Female Elf magic user!) Poisons could become healing potions! There are no limits as to what could happen!\n\nSolution: Simply retouch the mirror. However, if this solution is to easy, then the mirror may have moved to a different location, or players may have to find a completely differnt mirror(made of White Diamond?).\n\n', 'Letter Pattern\n\nThe party finds an old, stone door - not of dwarven design, but of humans. Above the door seven letters are carved boldly in the human script:\n\nW I T N L I T\n\nAccompaning the door is a statue of a human, fairly poorly carved. When the party approaches it speaks.\n\nWHAT IS THE NEXT LETTER IN THIS SEQUENCE ? \n\nFrench: Q E L P L D C\n\n Quelle est la prochaine lettre de cette série ?\n\nThe statue will take one answer from each party member. If noone can answer the statue then the door will remain firmly shut.\n\nAfterthought: The fact that the door and statue were human made hints that the puzzle may not have the usual dwarven depth and cunning. The \'riddle\' is a very simple letter puzzle - each is the starting letter of a word in the question the statue asked. The next letter is \'s\'.\n\nSolution: If players just begin to guess letters and by chance stumble upon the correct one, you can have the statue ask why. If they cannot tell you the correct method then they still cannot pass.\n\n', 'Voodoo Dungeon\n\nAfter players have fought their way through a fairly earth-based or magical dungeon they come across a small chamber with an intricate sculpture in the middle. You can pass the players a sketch of the winding shapes portrayed on this sculpture, and if they have been keeping an accurate map then the mystery of the carving will be revealed - the sculpture is a three dimensional map of the dungeon.\n\nThe sculpture is built on a raised board that reaches waste height on a human. Players can easily mainpulate the walls, doors or other features in the mock-up dungeon... but powerful, dark magic is attached to the board. If the players destroy a wall, the wall collapses elsewhere in the dungeon. If the players flick down a door, a door explodes somewhere else. Powerful voodoo magic is at work, and let Pelor help the fool who tries to destroy the entire board.\n\nAfterthought: The board is only a threat to party if they collapse any area that leads to the exit or any room a party member is in. Used appropriately, the sculpture can be used to destroy doors the party was unable to unlock or have the party gain access into entirely new areas.\n\nSolution: The magic used to create the sculpture was of a dark kind. Perhaps the DM could tell any clerics that they have a bad feeling about the board, leading to the suggestion it should be destroyed...\n\nIf the players realise how they can use board the dungeon can become their plaything. It is fair to say that that room is the \'heart\' of the dungeon - don\'t let the party find it too easily.\n\n', 'Acid Arrow Trap', 'Acid Spray', 'Arrow Blaster', 'Arrow Trap', 'Barbed Net Trap', 'Basic Arrow Trap', 'Built-to-Collapse Wall', 'Burning Hands Trap', 'Camouflaged Pit Trap', 'Ceiling Pendulum', 'Chain Flail', 'Compacting Room', 'Deeper Pit Trap', 'Earthmaw Trap', 'Electrified Floortile', 'Extended Bane Trap', 'Falling Block', 'Fire Spray', 'Fire Trap', 'Flame Strike Trap', 'Flamethrower', 'Fusillade of Darts', 'Fusillade of Spears', 'Ghoul Touch Trap', 'Glyph of Warding (Blast)', 'Greater Acid Spray', 'Guillotine Blade', 'Hail of Needles', 'Heavy Chain Flail', 'Ice Dart Trap', 'Ice Spear Trap', 'Idol of Chaos', 'Idol of Evil', 'Idol of Law', 'Large Electrified Floortile', 'Lightning Bolt Trap', 'Magic Missle Trap', 'Net Trap', 'Pit Trap', 'Poison Dart Trap', 'Poisoned Arrow Trap', 'Poisoned Guillotine Blade', 'Poisoned Net Trap', 'Portcullis Trap', 'Rolling Rock Trap', 'Rune of Confusion', 'Rune of Dread', 'Rune of Fear', 'Rune of Hypnosis', 'Rune of Paralyzation', 'Scythe Blade', 'Scything Blade Trap', 'Shrine of Chaos', 'Shrine of Evil', 'Shrine of Law', 'Spear Trap', 'Spiked Blocks from Ceiling', 'Spiked Pit Trap (100 ft.
