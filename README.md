# Dungeon Helper

I'm using this small website when game mastering roleplay sessions of dungeon
crawling. When I don't have a scenario ready but still want to offer my players
a fun evening, I use those generators on my cell phone to help me build a story.

Click on any part to generate a new random one.

Note: Description are both in french and english.

## Usage

If you want to run it locally:

```
npm install
npm run serve
```
